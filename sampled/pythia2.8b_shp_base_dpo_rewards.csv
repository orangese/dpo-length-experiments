Failing that you could consider challenging her to a duel, but since she's quite skilled that probably isn't the best idea.  A direct appeal to the Ministry of Magic or the Hogwarts board would be the next avenue to explore.","

Human: These lemon squares are going to give me an aneurysm Desperately seeking an answer. I have made lemon squares twice in my life (both times from the same New York Times Cooking recipe, written by Susan Mahnke Peery) and have had the same issue each time. I pre-bake the shortbread crust, then pour the lemon/egg mixture on top and bake at 350 for 20 minutes. I take the pan out of the oven, and just like with the time before, I have a thin layer of baked egg on top of the lemon curd. It’s like I’m living in some sort of dessert-based, Groundhog Day nightmare. In retrospect, I don’t know why I thought following the same recipe identically on two separate occasions would give me different results. What was it that Einstein said about insanity?

People are afraid of any rogue army that takes wild chances, will kill off tens of thousands of troops for no reason, and will brutalize anyone who resists. And the Separatists will always recover after every battle because they can just build more droids. And yet people see their Jedi protectors get fewer and fewer...and Grievous and Dooku are hella scary on their own.      In more detail:      First of all you have to realize Palpatine was not running a conventional war. He was both sides. If one side won, Palpatine *lost*.  Palpatine's goal was to prolong the war (and destabilize the republic enough to gain control) and kill Jedi. Once Palpatine achieved both goals (emergency powers + Order 66) the war was over and it was down to mopping things up. So Grievous had to keep the war burning and kill Jedi and he was great at both.     Who doesn't matter: The clones take time to replace but are essentially irrelevant to the war effort. They are team Palpatine either way so killing them is kind of irrelevant to Palpatine. (and Grievous, whether he knew it or not)      Jedi are who Palpatine *hates.* They stand in the way of his success and he can't fight them all and he could never train enough apprentices to tackle them head-on. Every single Jedi who lives is a big threat to his plans and his personal safety. Luckily there is a very, *very* limited number of Jedi. Force-users are one in a billion, require a lifetime to train to make them effective, have to be constantly retrained to prevent dark-side drift, and each one is essentially irreplaceable. Palpatine will never train enough apprentices to tackle the Jedi head-on. The only way to fight them is to divide them, stoke their inner conflicts, put innocent lives in danger so they take stupid risks, and focus so many blaster bolts at them that they cannot deflect them all and attrition wears them away.      The Separatists (who noticeably have a lot of business/industrial interests) are a custom designed foil for the Jedi with their nearly infinite number of droids. Droids are cheap, suicidally brave even against space-wizards with laser-swords, can be made nearly anywhere on an assembly line, and can fire a blaster. General Grievous can lose a ten-thousand cheap droids and retreat in a battle but along the way if he nails even *one* Jedi than he's doing great! And Palpatine would think that battle was great trade! In this way Grievous could lose every single battle, still remain in the fight and then *win* by steadily thinning out the Jedi.      During any of prequels or associated media do you ever hear about Palpatine complaining ""Grievous you've killed a Jedi but all those droids cost money buddy. We've got a budget you know."" Nope. Let it rain (droids), nobody cares! As mentioned Palpatine orchestrated the war for those two simple reasons: Cause turmoil with a prolonged conflict so he could seize power, and kill all dem Jedi. The Separatists, Dooku, and Grievous got the job done.","

Human: [Star Wars] Why are the Separatists and their droid army so feared? It seems like they lose most, if not all, of the battles the Republic engages them in Even their top general, General Grievous, seems to be extremely incompetent in military strategy, with him being beat back at almost every turn. Also, their droids are incredibly inaccurate for robots that have a built in aiming system.

The CIS has a droid army they could manufacture and just walk straight off the assembly line to fight. They could have far greater numbers much faster than the GAR, far easier to store and transport, requiring far less resources.  The Seperatist Super Battle Droids were akin to walking tanks, if not invulnerable to then at the very least HIGHLY resistant to small arms fire.  The Separatist Droidekas were highly mobile, extremely deadly droids able to be deployed quickly nearly anywhere to provide immediate support and immense firepower.  The Separatists had Droid commandos which were at the very least the equivalent of Clone Commandos, and which are far quicker to produce, repair, and replace.  While the GAR did have AT-TE and that the Separatist didn't really have an equivalent to that, the ease with which they are blown up by Hailfire droid tanks shows their armour mustn't have been that big of a problem.  In their favour the CIS has:  * near-endless numbers * ease of deployment * lesser operating costs * soldiers that are as efficient or less than the GAR, but far more numerous  In favour of the GAR they had:  * more intelligent troops * more creative troops * Jedi  The first two seem to be not that significant when each clone must kill more than 10 battle droids of the enemy army to match numbers, so the only real advantage the GAR had were a couple thousand Jedi, compared to their millions of battle droids.  Hell, I'm sure the Jedi were having a hard time with Separatist sniper droids, and they were being slowly killed in the war, which brings me to this huge conundrum that I don't know how to answer.  How on earth did the Separatists lose?","

For example, if you are on a $5 minimum BJ table with a limit of $250  that only allows you to play one hand you can bet 50 units.  House edge is a representation of the mathematical advantage that the house has built in its rules..  Here are some examples.   Roulette:  straight up bet pays 35 to 1.  I'd you win you get 35 plus your bet. There is 1 way to win, and on a double 0 wheel, 37 ways to lose. If you cover every number (stupid) you lose 38 and win 36.  So your return is 36/38.  That's 94.7% return  giving the house an edge of 5.3% Craps:  betting on a hop (one roll bet) pays to 30 for 1, 30 to 1, 15 for 1, or 15 to 1.  Deference here is academic in this case, most casinos only for one, but to one is better.  The 30s are for pairs (hard ways).  Let's say you think 11 will come next roll.  There are 2 ways to roll 11, 6-5, and 5-6, if you have problems seeing this, pretend the dice are different colors.  2 dice x 6 sides = 36 combos.   You have 2 ways to win out of 36.  Or, 1 in 18.  This bet at best pays 15 to 1.  So win 16, lose 18.  That's an 88.8% return giving the house an edge of 11.2%. SERIOUSLY, I KNOW HOP BETS SUCK.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOUSE EDGE.  Bet the pass line with 10x odds.  Happy?   The edge represents the difference between the true odds vs payable odds.  With me so far?    Here's where things change. In all other games of ""chance"", these odds never change.  Two dice always roll 11 with the same 2/36 chance, number 21 comes up approximately 1 out of 38 times in roulette. This is inescapable.  Short term variance is expected and even necessary,  no one would play a game where they always lost.  But blackjack and it's variants (of the non continuous shuffle variety) are different fundamentally, they have memory.  There a finite number of cards in that games universe if you will.  In a 6 deck shoe (suits don't matter in BJ) there are 312 cards. 24 of each A-9, and 96 10 value cards (10, J, Q, K no difference between these functionally) Basic strategy is a statistical model that, based on the  rules of the casino at which you are playing, help you make the least bad decision.  I say least bad, because it is accurate.  There are no good decisions in blackjack because statistically it is still a negative expectation game.  Meaning, over a large sampling, with perfect basic strategy, you will still lose.  Now, this is for everyone in the back, STATISTICAL OUTCOMES HAVE NOTING TO FUCKING DO WITH SHORT TERM SUCCESS OR FAILURE!!!!!!  So, a recap here.  Most games suck because the odds are bad and built in.  You can chose less bad bets, but all bets are bad, get it?  But wait,  you said Black Jack is different!  It is.  As I said,  basic strategy lets you make the least bad decisions.  Some situations actually have a positive expected outcome, like doubling down when you have 11 vs a dealers up card of 6.  Keep in mind though, that the aggregate of all those situations still places you in the territory of negative expectation.    Card counting:  there are plenty of tutorials online to teach this, but as a very simple rule of thumb, because of the rules of hitting and staying that casinos follow for their dealers, big cards favor the player, while little cards favor the dealer.  I'm not going to get into the math here, it's rather lengthy, but suffice to say that knowing the ratio of big cards to little cards remaining in the deck can offer an advantage to the player.    So, why does the dealer have the advantage on black jack?  It's not their hit/stand rules.  Those only exist because if they were any more lenient to the dealer no one would play.  THE ONLY ADVANTAGE THE HOUSE HAS IN BJ IS THE DOUBLE BUST LOSS. Scenario 1.  Player has 20, dealer busts.  Player wins Scenario 2.  Player has 20, dealer has 20.  Player pushes (ties) nobody loses/wins Scenario 3.  Player busts his hand, dealer has 20.  Dealer wins.  These all seem fair so far.  Here's the one that earns all the house it's money. Scenario 4.  Player busts his hand.  Dealer busts his hand.  Player still loses.  That's it.  They only advantage.  So, try not to take hits that can bust you unless you statistically need to.  Let's now regroup.   1.  You know that busting loses your money, though paradoxically, standing when you should hit, while reducing your bust %, actually lowers your statical overall win % more. 2.  You know that because 10s are good for you and little cards are bad, if you can keep track of the ratio of that and are in the right situation, you can have an advantage over the house.  The average difference in expressed advantage generally is only 2%.  Let's say the house has a 51-49 advantage over you, sometimes you can make that 51-49 in your favor with counting.  How do you take advantage of this?  Unit betting.   Let's take a $5 dollar table. It has 7 spots.  You are the only player.  It's max is$ 500. This casino let's you play all 7 spots if the table is empty.  Therefore, the unit spread is as follows 500/5 = 100 units per spot *7 spots = 700 unit spread.  (This is an example only, doing this will get you labeled as a counter on the spot and backed off immediately) As you know the deck (shoe) favors the dealer most of the time it makes sense to expose the least amount of your money to that negative expectation.  When the 10 ratio changes in your favor, you can now expose 700 times that bet to a positive outcome.   So while you're only going to have a %2 advantage, you're now betting 3500 with a better than even chance of winning.  (YES I KNOW THINGS GET STREAKY SOMETIMES.  SHUT UP, THESE ARE BASICS. GO FIND SOME COUNTING SUB REDDIT)  So, get it?  Expose less of you money when you're at a disadvantage and more when it's in your favor.  Counting is the exact reverse of the casino model.  You're eking out wins on a small marking, but unlike the casini, you can alter your betting and actions with this knowledge   TL;DR. yes, blackjack is the a beatable game, but only if you're a card counter.   P.s. baccarat.  Yes, it is a coin flip.  And yes, I've heard of a way to count it.  Here the only situation I know of where it can be counted.  At the beginning of the shoe, the dealer reveals the first card and burns that many cards.  If you can keep track of the 10s in the shoe, and this count of remaining 10 in the deck is equal to burn cards plus the remaining cards in the deck after the cut card is pulled out, theoretically you could guarantee a tie bet, but I'd be willing that this is sore rare in practice, you're better off just studying something useful and getting a career change or a promotion.  Sorry about the spelling, this is a long comment for a phone and my dog has been licking my face  Edits:  edited for grammar and spelling, as well as an expanded craps section because some random craps player thinks he knows what's going on and was confused.  As always first reddit gold, thanks so much.  Also, for people saying poker, pai-gow, video poker, craps!  I try not to talk about thing I don't know much about, but here: 1.  Poker is beatable if you're good.or with weak players.  2.  No commission pai-gow that let's you bank every other hand is probably close to 50-50. Don't know for sure, check the math. 3.  Apparently you can count baccarat, just got a link to look at. 4.  Yes, some video poker offers an advantage.  Google it 5.  Yes, crops has some good bets.  Pass with 10x odds is like .43% house edge or something stupid small.  Still not 0 6.  Advantage play tons of advanced techniques like shuffle tracking, hole tracking, taking advantage of weak delaers, sure that may make a game beatable.  YMMV","

Like, once an ace is played and discarded players know that ace is gone and won't be seen again.  Keeping track of what cards have been played can give a player good prediction of what will come up. Knowing that they can adjust their bets so they win big when odds are good and loose little when odds are bad.  Casinos fight against this by using multiple decks of cards, re-shuffling at random times, and good old intimidation.  ""Card counting"" (the simple process of keeping track of what's been played and understanding current odds) mathematically gives a player a 0.5% advantage over the house. Some say it's as high as 1%, some say 0.1%. But, no matter what, it won't make you rich over night. To see a 0.5% advantage pay off you'll have to play a lot and over a significant amount of time. Those who did get rich with card counting did it with a team.  And, don't forget, casinos can ask anyone to leave for no reason at all. If you're statistically winning more than you should, you may get a tap on your shoulder.  So, mathematically, yes, you'll have an advantage in blackjack because it is a continuing, past dependent, outcome.  But, in real life, you simply won't be allowed to sit at a table and take the Casino's money.","

Not a card counter  but know plenty who do (or did).  1) Perfect basic strategy without counting + good house rules gets you very close to 50% equity. It's over 49%. This is reduced significantly by bad house rules (ie pay 6:5 on blackjack).  You cannot get over 50% without counting and properly adjusting your bets based on the odds for that hand.  2) Part of why you can beat blackjack is the ""history"" as has been mentioned.  The other part is the ability to bet SIGNIFICANTLY more when you have an edge vs when you don't.  Betting $10 many times as 49.8% dog, and then $50 or $100 a few times as a 54% favorite, will yield positive equity and thus profit in the long run.  3) Blackjack is still very beatable, but casinos have gotten much smarter over the years.  The rules are generally worse and favor the house more than in years past.  They're better at spotting counters and teams.  I know a number of people who have made significant money (well into 6 figures) by counting, and have subsequently been banned or flat bet. It's a good way to make short-term money if you know what you're doing, but you need a significant bankroll as the swings can be enormous.  4) Assuming you're not counting, then other players playing correctly or incorrectly will NOT affect your equity. Someone hitting when they should stay is just as likely to help you as hurt you, so leave them alone and let them do as they please. Anyone saying otherwise does not understand statistics.  EDIT TO ADD  5) Some comments have mentioned poker, sports betting, horse racing, and certain video poker / slots as other profitable opportunities if you know what you're doing.  Poker is obviously true, as many people make their living playing poker.  The key difference is that you play against other players and simply pay the casino a flat rate, so they don't care if you win.  Literally thousands and probably tens of thousands of people around the world make their living playing poker, both in casinos and online.  Sports betting is true, although it takes a lot of work and very good computer models to beat it.  Also never, ever, ever pay for a tout service to give you picks.  100% of them are scams.  Horse racing I'm honestly not sure about, as I know next to nothing about it.  But I've been in Vegas a long time and have never met someone who is a professional horse bettor.  Anecdotally, everyone in that section of the sports book looks like a degenerate (or someone just having fun on vacation).  But maybe?  If anyone knows more I'd like to hear.  Video poker / slots is also true under certain circumstances.  Some of the progressive jackpot slots can actually be pretty lucrative when the jackpot gets big enough, but it's an enormous time sink and requires an enormous bankroll.  I know people that have tried to take advantage, and they give up after not too long.  The edge on profitable video poker machines is small and you're not going to make any significant money grinding those.  Minimum wage maybe.  People who are VERY good at heads up limit holdem can beat the poker machines (NOT video poker, but actual poker played against an AI).  The AI is awfully good though, and will absolutely obliterate a random tourist.  They put these things outside of poker rooms and they must absolutely print money on them to an absurd degree.","

Big cards good, small cards bad.  5 year-olds shouldn't gamble anyways.   Source: former casino employee and card counter.  I'll start with some terms here:  House edge: expressed in a percentage.  The money the house expect to win on each bet.    Basic stragety: a tested theorem that that dictates a players move in a given blackjack hand. Please Google basic strategy,  there's a neat color coded chart you can look at.  Units: the number of increments of the minimum bet that the table maximum will allow.  For example, if you are on a $5 minimum BJ table with a limit of $250  that only allows you to play one hand you can bet 50 units.  House edge is a representation of the mathematical advantage that the house has built in its rules..  Here are some examples.   Roulette:  straight up bet pays 35 to 1.  I'd you win you get 35 plus your bet. There is 1 way to win, and on a double 0 wheel, 37 ways to lose. If you cover every number (stupid) you lose 38 and win 36.  So your return is 36/38.  That's 94.7% return  giving the house an edge of 5.3% Craps:  betting on a hop (one roll bet) pays to 30 for 1, 30 to 1, 15 for 1, or 15 to 1.  Deference here is academic in this case, most casinos only for one, but to one is better.  The 30s are for pairs (hard ways).  Let's say you think 11 will come next roll.  There are 2 ways to roll 11, 6-5, and 5-6, if you have problems seeing this, pretend the dice are different colors.  2 dice x 6 sides = 36 combos.   You have 2 ways to win out of 36.  Or, 1 in 18.  This bet at best pays 15 to 1.  So win 16, lose 18.  That's an 88.8% return giving the house an edge of 11.2%. SERIOUSLY, I KNOW HOP BETS SUCK.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOUSE EDGE.  Bet the pass line with 10x odds.  Happy?   The edge represents the difference between the true odds vs payable odds.  With me so far?    Here's where things change. In all other games of ""chance"", these odds never change.  Two dice always roll 11 with the same 2/36 chance, number 21 comes up approximately 1 out of 38 times in roulette. This is inescapable.  Short term variance is expected and even necessary,  no one would play a game where they always lost.  But blackjack and it's variants (of the non continuous shuffle variety) are different fundamentally, they have memory.  There a finite number of cards in that games universe if you will.  In a 6 deck shoe (suits don't matter in BJ) there are 312 cards. 24 of each A-9, and 96 10 value cards (10, J, Q, K no difference between these functionally) Basic strategy is a statistical model that, based on the  rules of the casino at which you are playing, help you make the least bad decision.  I say least bad, because it is accurate.  There are no good decisions in blackjack because statistically it is still a negative expectation game.  Meaning, over a large sampling, with perfect basic strategy, you will still lose.  Now, this is for everyone in the back, STATISTICAL OUTCOMES HAVE NOTING TO FUCKING DO WITH SHORT TERM SUCCESS OR FAILURE!!!!!!  So, a recap here.  Most games suck because the odds are bad and built in.  You can chose less bad bets, but all bets are bad, get it?  But wait,  you said Black Jack is different!  It is.  As I said,  basic strategy lets you make the least bad decisions.  Some situations actually have a positive expected outcome, like doubling down when you have 11 vs a dealers up card of 6.  Keep in mind though, that the aggregate of all those situations still places you in the territory of negative expectation.    Card counting:  there are plenty of tutorials online to teach this, but as a very simple rule of thumb, because of the rules of hitting and staying that casinos follow for their dealers, big cards favor the player, while little cards favor the dealer.  I'm not going to get into the math here, it's rather lengthy, but suffice to say that knowing the ratio of big cards to little cards remaining in the deck can offer an advantage to the player.    So, why does the dealer have the advantage on black jack?  It's not their hit/stand rules.  Those only exist because if they were any more lenient to the dealer no one would play.  THE ONLY ADVANTAGE THE HOUSE HAS IN BJ IS THE DOUBLE BUST LOSS. Scenario 1.  Player has 20, dealer busts.  Player wins Scenario 2.  Player has 20, dealer has 20.  Player pushes (ties) nobody loses/wins Scenario 3.  Player busts his hand, dealer has 20.  Dealer wins.  These all seem fair so far.  Here's the one that earns all the house it's money. Scenario 4.  Player busts his hand.  Dealer busts his hand.  Player still loses.  That's it.  They only advantage.  So, try not to take hits that can bust you unless you statistically need to.  Let's now regroup.   1.  You know that busting loses your money, though paradoxically, standing when you should hit, while reducing your bust %, actually lowers your statical overall win % more. 2.  You know that because 10s are good for you and little cards are bad, if you can keep track of the ratio of that and are in the right situation, you can have an advantage over the house.  The average difference in expressed advantage generally is only 2%.  Let's say the house has a 51-49 advantage over you, sometimes you can make that 51-49 in your favor with counting.  How do you take advantage of this?  Unit betting.   Let's take a $5 dollar table. It has 7 spots.  You are the only player.  It's max is$ 500. This casino let's you play all 7 spots if the table is empty.  Therefore, the unit spread is as follows 500/5 = 100 units per spot *7 spots = 700 unit spread.  (This is an example only, doing this will get you labeled as a counter on the spot and backed off immediately) As you know the deck (shoe) favors the dealer most of the time it makes sense to expose the least amount of your money to that negative expectation.  When the 10 ratio changes in your favor, you can now expose 700 times that bet to a positive outcome.   So while you're only going to have a %2 advantage, you're now betting 3500 with a better than even chance of winning.  (YES I KNOW THINGS GET STREAKY SOMETIMES.  SHUT UP, THESE ARE BASICS. GO FIND SOME COUNTING SUB REDDIT)  So, get it?  Expose less of you money when you're at a disadvantage and more when it's in your favor.  Counting is the exact reverse of the casino model.

Like, once an ace is played and discarded players know that ace is gone and won't be seen again.  Keeping track of what cards have been played can give a player good prediction of what will come up. Knowing that they can adjust their bets so they win big when odds are good and loose little when odds are bad.  Casinos fight against this by using multiple decks of cards, re-shuffling at random times, and good old intimidation.  ""Card counting"" (the simple process of keeping track of what's been played and understanding current odds) mathematically gives a player a 0.5% advantage over the house. Some say it's as high as 1%, some say 0.1%. But, no matter what, it won't make you rich over night. To see a 0.5% advantage pay off you'll have to play a lot and over a significant amount of time. Those who did get rich with card counting did it with a team.  And, don't forget, casinos can ask anyone to leave for no reason at all. If you're statistically winning more than you should, you may get a tap on your shoulder.  So, mathematically, yes, you'll have an advantage in blackjack because it is a continuing, past dependent, outcome.  But, in real life, you simply won't be allowed to sit at a table and take the Casino's money.","

I'm focusing here on ""seem like every time an economist speaks"" rather than the content of the question because many mainstream economists have endorsed positions much too wacky to be considered by the political system.  For instance, see Milton Friedman's ""helicopter money.""  This term gets mocked by the mainstream press pretty much every time it comes, yet one can practically define mainstream economics by the distance to Friedman.  Often times in the MSM you will see traders masquerading as economists, but real academic economists can be as disconnected from society as the rest of academia.","

Unfortunately, for any company that provide a media product (which is what the Hearthstone tournaments were), the media product's value is drastically devalued by allowing it to be used as a political platform. Think about, for instance, a player chanting ""Build the Wall"", or ""Impeach Trump now"" on the stream - this would have a similar effect. 2. Blizzard had to act in order to prevent its content (and platform) from being hijacked for political purposes. 3. Blizzard probably went too far in its punishment of the player and the casters. 4. However, the reaction, and the backlash, as you put it, have been completely out of proportion as well.  5. The amount of effort, and noise, as you put it, seen on reddit seem to me to be the symptom of Blizzard being the easiest thing to virtue signal, or have a group outrage, about. It's very within Reddit's base to have a Blizzard account, and for such persons to have viable alternatives to Blizzard, that it was the ""cheapest"" way of making a statement. No similar campaign was made of Disney, Apple, NBA, or indeed any other company or company representative that took a stand on Hong Kong. 6. If the stated aim is to pressure the Chinese government, then Blizzard is absolutely the wrong target as well - the Chinese Govt certainly doesn't care about any Blizzard boycott. The Chinese players of Hearthstone aren't affected by your boycott either - in fact, they would probably benefit if Blizzard would focus more attention on their market as opposed to the West. 7. Blizzard, as a private company and not a govt, cannot censor anything. They are free to decide what messages go out on their product, same as how Chick-fil-a is free to decide not to open on Sunday.  Therefore, while I do think that people have every right to boycott Blizzard if they feel strongly enough about it, I think Blizzard is in an unfortunate confluence of factors creating a perfect storm for the outrage on reddit.","

Whether its to ban racist players from their service or someone who is generally disagreeable and gets enough complaints against them or someone smoking weed on camera or for a number of different reasons.  Twitch is famous for banning their content providers who use their service for nudity or for sex work.  The questions isn't whether it's censorship or not, it most certainly is, but whether or not it's allowable under their rules of play.  I'm not familiar with Blizzard's rules so I couldn't say one way or the other, but they are claiming that it's a violation of their ToS.  If so, then it's within their purview, whether we consider it morally repugnant or not.","

China is a huge chunk of blizzards income, enough so that it could very well be the end of them if they got on the wrong side of China's firewall. And everyone expects them to die on that hill in order to make a statement/do the morally sound thing.  Should they? Again, morally, yes, and its something that needs to happen if we don't want China walking all over our economy, but looking at it objectively and without emotion I can't say I blame them.  That said, I think the backlash is a good thing and needs to continue. Blizzard came to the conclusion that the consiquences of angering the Chinese market outweighed the consiquences of angering the Western market. Making them regret this decision and not yield to the Chinese government in the future is what we need to happen, so the backlash and bad PR is the pressure that will hopefully make that happen.  Tldr; everything people are doing in response to blizzards actions is a good thing, but I think people humanize companies too much.","

We don't quite understand how these form, but theories range from black holes mergers, to direct collapse black holes. What further adds to the puzzle is that we have observed some supermassive black holes very soon after the Big Bang, when there hasn't really been enough time to allow for the repeated mergers of smaller back holes.

She’s going through a lot of changes and it sounds like you’re trying to be as attentive as possible.   Research says girls that start puberty younger struggle with body image, self esteem, and anxiety more than their male counterparts and girls who have puberty later. “Why is my brain doing this to me” sounds like anxiety. There are many many coping skills that she can learn to help this. Therapy could be a huge help. It’s not just for “crazy people.” Sounds like she just needs a few skills to help her out.   In terms of interacting with her, remind her that she’s safe, you have her covered, and that there is nothing wrong with her. Feelings are not facts. And she’s going to be ok.","

Human: Im afraid I’m losing my 9 year old daughter. My daughter just turned 9 a couple weeks ago. Her life has taken a major turn. She’s been the funniest, happiest girl here whole life and now it’s like something took over her brain.  She all of a sudden is stressed all the time, scared to go anywhere, even school. She cries all the time and says “What’s wrong with me!” “I wish this could be taken away.” “Why is my brain doing this to me!?”  It’s absolutely heartbreaking seeing her, especially at such a young age, go through this.  She did start going through puberty early. Starting when she was 7.5 she skyrocketed in height, developed breast and has pubic hair. Though hasnt started her period. If you look at photos of her the year before she doesn’t look like the same person.  Could her issues be related to puberty? Would hormone blockers help her? Are they safe? I miss my happy girl and hate seeing her suffer.

Did she see a doctor when this was happening? If not, she should to make sure there’s not any kind of physical problems that caused it that could cause other issues.  Its very hard to say what's going on, but its clear that something has changed. It could be anything from physical/hormonal problems, bullying, anxiety, school stress, even abuse or harassment by somebody. Going through puberty as a young child is really difficult, especially as a girl who will unfortunately start receiving unwanted attention once they start physically maturing—because people are disgusting. See if you can talk to her and figure out what’s happening. Whether or not she wants to talk to you, I would suggest you try to get her to speak to a counselor or therapist who can help her work through whatever’s happening.  I wish you the best.","

Human: How dense is a nebula such as the Carina nebula in the JWST photos? What would the sky be likely to look like from a planet in a cloudy nebula?

You'd probably see a similarly milky sky. The tallest towers seen in the new photograph are about 7 light years tall, for reference.   Also, keep in mind the colors in the photo have been shifted to frequencies we can see with our eyes. A lot of that would be invisible to you without the shift from infrared.","

I used to make em. it was the ""dirty little secret"" protected by the insane NDA everyone has to sign when they start The \*difference\* was that they used fan-assisted (convection ovens) which most folks don't have at home.  OK, that said, Ms Fields is crap. There is a bakery in Manhattan called ""Levain Bakery"" that makes quite possibly the world's best chocolate chip cookie.  Bakers from all over the world have come there to try them and then try their hand at reverse-engineering them. The two best that I have seen are from Joshua Weissman: (guest starring Babish) https://youtu.be/NYH1Z7TUSEI  And Cupcake Jemma, who not only reverse engineered them but has like a dozen different varieties now too like white chocolate, macadamia and matcha,  caramelized white chocolate (i mean), and even a birthday cake version.https://youtu.be/P1gqm9CG8sw","

If you make them big, you'll have to flatten the top of the balls so that they come out cookie shaped instead of ball shaped. Also, be sure you dont skip chilling the dough and that your oven in fully preheated (usually takes longer than when it beeps)  If you want a super soft sugar cookie, look for one that have cream cheese or shortening in the recipe and cut them thick.  For oatmeal cookies, the recipe that used to be on the lid of the canister of oats always made a super chewy cookie.","

Cancers in the GI tract especially around the stomach, pancreas and initial small bowel can cause anorexia (lack of appetite), early satiety (feeling full quickly) and nausea, through tumour mass taking up physical space in the gut, through chemical release and through invasion of the nerves supplying the gut. It is because of these effects that unintentional weight loss over a relatively short period of time sets off alarm bells and is seen as a ""red flag symptom"".  Treatments of cancer can also affect weight: - chemotherapy can cause horrendous nausea and vomiting but can also strip away the lining of the bowel, causing inadequate absorption of your food.  - chemotherapy is also very metabolically demanding; by essentially damaging cells throughout the body (hence why hair falls out), the body is forced to replenish them, those using energy - radiation treatments of the mouth, throat and chest can cause burns and scarring of the oesophagus and make it difficult or even uncomfortable to eat - plus surgeries etc are hugely demanding, not including bowel surgery affecting ingestion and absorption of food!!  Hope that helps.","

Some cancers have a massive metabolic requirement, others can directly interfere with food consumption, ingestion, or absorption which can individually or collectively result in weight loss. The treatments for cancer can cause blisters in the mouth which can be extremely painful. Chemotherapy and radiation can also cause nausea and vomiting which result in weight loss. As the above posters have mentioned cachexia is a component as well. Cachexia is a symptom of severe metabolic imbalance, basically the calories burned are exceeding the calories ingested which can happen in a variety of situations not just cancer.","

Age of Ultron: Tony still wasn’t much of a team player. He didn’t trust the other Avengers enough to discuss the “Suit of Armor Around the World” idea and created Ultron with Bruce. Later Cap said that they win together or lose together.    Infinity War and Endgame : Tony discussed plans twice. Once on the Donut Ship with Strange and Peter. The other on Titan with Starlort and the team on Titan. Tony also wanted the Avengers together when fighting Thanos and his team. Another example is when the Avengers were brainstorming the Time Heist during endgame. During Age of Ultron, Tony only consulted Bruce because he wanted smart people. During the Time Heist planing, everybody got to have their voice heard. Doing it together like how Cap does it.    So while Tony did sacrifice himself, Cap lead him to be a better person, so that when the time came, Tony made a good decision. Cap also retired after Tony died.","

Cap represented the other side of the coin, that felt those in power would hinder, twist and corrupt the heroes who had the power and freedom to make a difference.   Also, Cap's whole thing is American iconography. the red white and blue outfit. The shield with the star and stripes, the whole ""No, YOU move"" mentality, etc.","

Human: [MCU] why would Captain America be honored on the Statue of Liberty and not Iron Man Captain never actually saved America directly besides WW2 (and that one is debatable since Germany was already on the brink of defeat).   In Avengers 1 Tony was the one who took the nuke into space.   In Avengers 2 it was Tony with the help of Thor who destroyed the Ultron meteor.   In Endgame the credit should be clearly given to Tony as the one who actually sacrificed himself instead of selfishly (I went there) living out his life with his wife and daughter (like he deserved to do).   Even if you where to attribute the take down of shield and the helicarriers to Cap it wasn’t made public knowledge (I don’t think) and that wasn’t a world ending threat like the ones Tony saved.   Plus the events of civil war have him branded as a traitor to the country and a fugitive abroad.   Even if it wasn’t to honor Steve Rodgers, the captain America image was partially tarnished as seen in falcon and winter soldier show.   So what was the actual reason to put a cap shield on the statue (which is pretty disrespectful to the actual statue by the way)?  Not to be too salty but the only reason I can think of is Cap fandom.

This would theoretically be something that would stand for centuries.  When looking back on some of history's most famous or memorable people, you learn A LOT about them.  And this is even before the information age.  Tony may have greater achievements and sacrifices, but he also has an extensive and exhaustively documented life as an opportunistic asshole with an inflated ego to boot.  He's been an asshole longer than he hasn't been, and he's a smartass that thinks he can take what he wants simply because his wallet is bigger.  Against that kind of scrutiny, Steve is basically Jesus Christ in the flesh.  When considering the long term implications of who they pick, it isn't even an argument between Steve and Tony, it's an argument between Steve and just about every Avenger and their counterparts when compared to future members centuries down the line.  Steve is the obvious choice, and I'm having a really hard time conceiving of a close second.  Even Steve being labeled a renegade and war criminal would be something history is going to be quick to correct.  ALSO, just for good measure, consider why some of the bad events happened - The US President was kidnapped with Tony's tech, Ultron is unquestionably Stark Tech to just about any random passerby with half a brain.  Add in that he's best friends with a ranging green menace that has terrorized many communities, it's not a good light.  &#x200B;  Let's consider an alternative; After Steve stops the bombs in The First Avenger, they then redecorate the Status of Liberty with his appearance.  From like 1950 onward it's Cap.  Would you then support changing it to Tony?  Or would that be disrespectful to Cap's sacrifice and the history of the statue for all those decades.","

Cap and the rest of the SRR managed to turn up at HYDRA's main/last base with minutes to spare, and Cap got onboard Red Skull's bomber with no seconds to spare.

That should give you an idea of who to contact.  2. Add up the sum total of your charges to that card.  3. Contact anyone you think the card might belong to and verify that they're getting erroneous charges from Uber/Grubhub/whatever. This might take some doing because they haven't stopped it, cancelled the card etc. so it's possible they haven't noticed.  4. Offer to reimburse them the full amount you've spent. Personally, if it was me, I'd offer the full amount plus 10% for the mix-up but that's up to you.   At that point, a reasonable person would either accept your offer to reimburse them (with interest if you choose to go that route) or not. If they don't they might decide to take some sort of legal action against you and I can't advise you on that beyond knowing that \*most\* crimes require intent in some form.","

The title sums up my situation pretty accurately, but I'll provide a bit more details.  I needed to take an Uber home a few months ago, and my default payment with my debit card was being denied so I used a card which I assumed was my father's, which I had on file with Uber as I used it before. This same situation happened with GrubHub, as well. I've been using the card for about 4-6 months. I asked my father about this last night to which he replied it wasn't his card. We double-checked his cards and mine to find out that it's neither of our cards.

Have you made any attempt to remedy the situation with your financial institution? I think this will be a very important part of this. If you have not made an attempt to sort out why your card is being declined and continued to use a card that was not in your name that could very much be an issue. Was the card declined due to insufficient funds, or a bank error?  The idea of you continuing to use a card for 4-6 months without notifying the owner of the card which you thought was your father is a little confusing but also I do not know your relationship, nor will I pretend to. I understand that it you believed it was your father, but it is important to understand that that is still not your card.  2. How much have you charged to that card as well? Again this is not your money, but knowing how much it is could be a decent difference. If it truly was an accident and was a small amount of transactions, personally while whoever owns the card has every right to be furious with you. I don't know if  legal action against you would be worth it, you should continue to do your due diligence to figure out who the card belongs to and repay them the funds. However if we are talking in the upwards of thousands, you could be looking at a different idea picture entirely. 3. My last push for you here would be to look into the billing information attached to the card within those applications. Typically from what I utilize there should be additional information available  At the end of the day, I do not see this going farther than you having a truly pissed off card holder, that will look to retrieve the funds from you. You owe this person these funds, which I am sure you already know and are accounting for. Hope this situation does not go farther than a couple of angry texts, and you reimbursing them.

Human: Former PhD supervisor presented a poster at a major conference based on my dissertation without telling me and put himself as first author - Is this unethical and how should I respond? Some Background:   I graduated recently with my PhD and I have been trying to turn my dissertation chapters into published articles. My supervisor has been sitting on these manuscripts for months \(one since November \-\-\- 5 months ago\) saying he hasn't found the time to read them and send feedback. This is despite the fact that I stressed to him several times how critical these publications were to me getting a job and building a career \(I do not yet have any publications from my PhD time\). I was lucky enough to secure a post\-doc anyways, despite my publication record \(although  I lost out on 3 before that specifically for that reason\), on the premise that these publications were forthcoming.  The Current Issue:  I was not able to attend a major conference this year, but a colleague contacted me to tell me they saw ""my poster,"" which I didn't know I had.  It turns out my former supervisor had made a conference poster based on a chapter from my dissertation without telling me. In fact, the graphs are copy and pasted from the chapter/manuscript that he ""hasn't had time to read"" since November. Moreover, he listed himself as the first author and as far as I can tell didn't even cite my dissertation \(My friend sent me a blurry picture of the poster\). He did list me as the second author.  So, I could use some advice.  1.\) Is this unethical behavior? My instinct is that it's at least borderline unethical, but I don't want to blow this out of proportion. The fact that he did not tell me bothers me for several reasons including not knowing to add the poster to my CV \(which I need since he hasn't let me publish\) and the fact that I feel like he gave himself more credit for this work than he deserves \(Yes, it's his lab's research but I did a significant proportion of the work involved\).  2.\) Should I say something? If this is unethical behavior, I do not think I should let it slide as that will only encourage him to do stuff like this to future students, nor do I want to set a precedent of being a push\-over \(for myself and to others\).

Also putting in some of your figures doesn’t mean he has edited/read your whole dissertation. Also posters are more minor so he probably didn’t even thing to tell you. Mine has done the same. Once you have a couple in your CV adding another isn’t going to make or break you.   So to wrap up: not unethical, pretty common, don’t confront.   Another note: PIs sitting on manuscripts for a long time is insanely common. Mines been on my PIs desk since Nov as well. And making a poster is nowhere near as much of a time suck as editing a manuscript. Also it’s not like he can put off the conference, that has a hard deadline whereas your manuscript doesn’t.","

Human: Former PhD supervisor presented a poster at a major conference based on my dissertation without telling me and put himself as first author - Is this unethical and how should I respond? Some Background:   I graduated recently with my PhD and I have been trying to turn my dissertation chapters into published articles. My supervisor has been sitting on these manuscripts for months \(one since November \-\-\- 5 months ago\) saying he hasn't found the time to read them and send feedback. This is despite the fact that I stressed to him several times how critical these publications were to me getting a job and building a career \(I do not yet have any publications from my PhD time\). I was lucky enough to secure a post\-doc anyways, despite my publication record \(although  I lost out on 3 before that specifically for that reason\), on the premise that these publications were forthcoming.  The Current Issue:  I was not able to attend a major conference this year, but a colleague contacted me to tell me they saw ""my poster,"" which I didn't know I had.  It turns out my former supervisor had made a conference poster based on a chapter from my dissertation without telling me. In fact, the graphs are copy and pasted from the chapter/manuscript that he ""hasn't had time to read"" since November. Moreover, he listed himself as the first author and as far as I can tell didn't even cite my dissertation \(My friend sent me a blurry picture of the poster\). He did list me as the second author.  So, I could use some advice.  1.\) Is this unethical behavior? My instinct is that it's at least borderline unethical, but I don't want to blow this out of proportion. The fact that he did not tell me bothers me for several reasons including not knowing to add the poster to my CV \(which I need since he hasn't let me publish\) and the fact that I feel like he gave himself more credit for this work than he deserves \(Yes, it's his lab's research but I did a significant proportion of the work involved\).  2.\) Should I say something? If this is unethical behavior, I do not think I should let it slide as that will only encourage him to do stuff like this to future students, nor do I want to set a precedent of being a push\-over \(for myself and to others\). Also, he has been delaying publications for months and months and yet had the time to make a poster based on the work that he claims he hasn't had the time to get to.   3.\) If I am going to say something, do you have any advice on what I should say or how I should frame the issue?

She has even suggested giving one of my data sets to the new grad student to use because I have left academia and have no intention of publishing it outside of my dissertation.    I would still be a co\-author on anything that comes from this project, so it is fine with me if I can get that credit without doing any more work. I insisted on publishing most of my dissertation chapters as I finished them rather than waiting until the NSF grant was finished, so that I could be first author on all of the high impact work, which I planned and conducted before the grant. I'm not expecting that much more to come out of the project at this point since the ongoing work is just a continuation of what I already did, but in another location/study system. My only concern is that my advisor may ask me to help analyze the data from the second study system if she and the new grad student aren't able to run my models.   Yes, it annoys me at times that my advisor takes credit for my project because she is the PI of the NSF grant, even though the grant is based on duplicating work I already did myself with my own fellowship/grant funding. For example, my last paper was published last week in a high impact journal.  I came up with the idea, secured my own funding, designed the protocol, did all the data collection and analyses, and wrote the paper. My advisor edited the manuscript for minor text fixes. And yet when the paper came out, I was forwarded/cc'd on multiple emails congratulating my advisor. The press release for the paper contains multiple quotes from my advisor and refers to the study as ""\<advisor\>'s work."" But in the end I am still first author on the paper itself, which is all that matters.   So if I were you would let the presentation go. Being first vs co\-author on a presentation is much less important than it is for a paper. I would just send your advisor an email requesting that you be kept in the loop on presentations so that you can add them to your CV.  Your advisor sitting on your manuscripts is a separate issue, and that is the one I think you should address.","

Most nuclear plants still do this manually, newer plants use automatic synchronization circuits.   What we will do is turn on the synch scope. The scope is connected to the bus and the generator, and the resulting out of phase voltages cause the scope to move forward or backward. The scope is round with a needle, like a clock. When the arrow is facing straight up, that means both sources are in phase.   So how we will synchronize the generator, is after the synch scope is on, we check the voltage difference on a meter, and adjust generator voltage to match grid voltage.   Once voltage is matched, we adjust the turbine/generator governor to adjust frequency. We aim to have the synch scope rotating slowly in the clockwise direction. 1 rpm on the scope or less for a large generator. When the scope rotates clockwise, it means we are slightly ahead of grid frequency, and at less than 1 rpm, we are very close to grid frequency. Then we wait until the needle is about straight up (at the 12 o'clock position) where phase is matched. At this point we will close the generator output breaker.   Once the breaker closes, for the power grid, phase voltage and frequency of the generator will all lock onto grid voltage. The fact that we were slightly faster than the grid means that once we synchronize, we will be putting real power out onto the grid. (If we were slower, the grid would be reverse powering the generator and it would trip).   At this point we will raise governor settings up to put load on the grid and close our steam dumps, while also gaining margin to our reverse power trip. Finally we adjust the voltage regulator to set reactive power and bus voltage where the transmission operators want it.   If you have any questions let me know. I'll see if I can get a video of this in the next day or two from our simulator.","

Human: If two power plants feed AC voltage/current into the same electricity grid, how do we make sure they are in the same phase to not cancel out each other? If two power generators feed a sinusoidal voltage into the grid, but one has a phase difference of 180° to the other, wouldn't the voltages cancel each other out?    So after the voltage of the power plant is transformed into the appropriate voltage, how do we make sure the voltages have appropriate phase differences? Or does it not make any difference what phase the feeded voltage of each power plant is?

To answer your first question yes, if you connect out of phase things will go badly. think smoke and fire.  A 3-phase generator has a Y frame in the inside each spoke 120 degrees apart with a winding on each. Each spoke generates one of the phases.  The generator spins exactly 60 times a second to give use the 60Hz AC signal.    So now you are ready to hook to the grid but you are out of phase. All you need to do is briefly changes the speed of your generators. Something is driving the spinning of the generator mostly in power plants its a steam engine with the steam coming from burning a fossil fuel or a nuclear pile.  So you adjust the steam engine to say 59.99 hz and now your phase difference relative to the grid that is at 60 Hz will start to move. Once it gets in phase you step up your engine back to 60HZ and connect.  Over time you and the power grid won't both be exactly at 60 hz so you need to monitor the grid phase and have a feedback system to your generator to speed up or slow down in order to stay in phase.","

Our local electrical generator, Eskom, had a small coal fired power station, which was primarily used for training purposes. The station gets stripped down and rebuilt periodically, as part of their training. This includes removing and reinstalling the taps on the transformers that feed the frequency gauges.  This particular occasion, the taps were installed backwards, resulting in a reading that was 180 degrees out of phase. So when the dial speed spinning, indicating that they were in sync with the grid, and they closed the breaker, the grid effectively said Nope!  Since the grid was backed by thousands of megawatts, and this was something like a 30 MW turbine, the grid won. The turbine stopped turning instantly, only to start turning again 1/60th of a second later. This resulted in a multiple ton turbine being launched out of the building and over the river several hundred meters away.  The facility was closed down, and never used again.  According to my recollection of the story, this happened in the 1950's or thereabouts, which explains why i have not been able to verify the story.","

While attempting to negotiate where in range C my pay would actually land, the HR rep stated that upon further review of my application I actually am to be placed in Range B now but that I would be eligible for range C after 5 months. She apologized for the mistake. However, I have the formal offer saying range C and that is what I originally accepted. Im not sure what to do. Do they have to honor their original offer? Also , lets say I do accept range B now, is an email enough proof for ""getting it in writing"" from the employer that in 5 months I will be move up to range C?

A counteroffer (negotiation) functions as both a rejection of an offer to enter into a contract, as well as a new offer that materially changes the terms of the original offer. Because a counteroffer serves as a rejection, it completely voids the original offer. This means that the original offer can no longer be accepted.","

Galaxies didn't form til later, and the structures that were present in the early universe are so redshifted that they're invisible to the naked eye","

Human: Why don't galaxies from the early universes appear to have a larger angular size compared to galaxies closer to us? I was looking at some of the pictures taken by the JWTS and it occurred to me that because the universe has grown in size since the light was emitted from the earliest galaxies, wouldn't the angular size of the oldest galaxies should be larger than galaxies in the foreground from our perspective? I'm thinking about it sorta like if you half inflate a balloon, draw an image on it, and then continue to blow it up, the image would appear stretched and larger.     My guess; between when the universe first became visible and now, the universe hasn't expanded much and that older galaxies are larger than they appear, but not by much.

First of all the expansion of space doesn’t change the actual shape of galaxies, at least not appreciably. The shape of space time in galaxies is dominated by their mass which overwhelms any contribution from dark energy which would otherwise cause an expansion.   However if we graph the angular size of galaxies against distance we do see that after a certain point it ‘turns over’. This is not due to the expansion stretching out galaxies, but because when the light from them was emitted they were much closer, and so the image of them in the sky is larger.","

I was looking at some of the pictures taken by the JWTS and it occurred to me that because the universe has grown in size since the light was emitted from the earliest galaxies, wouldn't the angular size of the oldest galaxies should be larger than galaxies in the foreground from our perspective? I'm thinking about it sorta like if you half inflate a balloon, draw an image on it, and then continue to blow it up, the image would appear stretched and larger.     My guess; between when the universe first became visible and now, the universe hasn't expanded much and that older galaxies are larger than they appear, but not by much.

The two are related but not identical. The way I explain it to students is a person can believe there are 26 Justices on the Supreme Court and they would be wrong, but they don't have to believe there is some grand conspiracy hiding the true number of Justices to be wrong. They're misinformed. And a person in, say, September 1972 could think that this whole Watergate break-in is kind of fishy and maybe some government higher-ups were involved. They believe a conspiracy is a afoot and they also happen to be right (i.e. not misinformed). The two often do go hand-in-hand (NBA player Kyrie Irving has on several occasions suggested the world is flat. He is misinformed and also necessarily believes a cabal of governments and scientists have been secretly trying to trick everyone into thinking the world is round for...reasons...so he also believes a conspiracy theory). There's also the differences between misinformation and disinformation (there's a known maliciousness to the latter). I think we can mostly set aside disinformation for this specific example, however.  Let's start with your initial point about conspiracy theories and Fox News. There are examples of conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19, for example that it was manufactured in a lab by Chinese scientists.  Why does anyone, and especially Republicans (the Pew data doesn't include Fox News viewership so we don't have that specifically), believe such a thing? Because they are predisposed to believe conspiracy theories and because this particular one has aligned with their political beliefs. Some people appear more susceptible to conspiracy theories and there's nothing right or left about it. But such people will be much more likely to believe a conspiracy if it also aligns with their political identity. Liberals/Democrats don't make up the Pizzagate rank and file. So Fox News viewers are more likely to subscribe to such conspiracy theories because they're a group with highly salient political identities and because Fox News serves as a conduit for the political elites who represent those identities to stress why believing such a conspiracy theory would align with their politics. I also recommend this book for more on the subject of conspiracy theories in general.  That said, I think what we're really discussing here is misinformation. The engine that makes misinformation run is motivated reasoning. All reasoning is motivated, but sometimes it is motivated to achieve partisanship goals (i.e. to make yourself feel good/smug about your political identity) and sometimes it is motivated to achieve accuracy goals (to get the right answer). When motivated by partisanship, people: a) search out information that conforms to their preexisting beliefs (confirmation bias), b) rank congruent arguments as more credible (prior attitude effect), and c) expend more cognitive resources counter-arguing incongruent arguments (disconfirmation bias). The last two are really key for misinformation. When a person encounters a bit of misinformation (let's say that social distancing doesn't work), if that would make them feel better about their politics (then we should start the economy back up which will help Trump get reelected) they will rank it as credible. When they encounter corrective information that tells them they're wrong (actually it does work), they will then work harder to find a reason not to accept this new information.  Under both conspiracy theories and misinformation, Fox News doesn't need any special psychological tricks to mislead their audience. All they need is a clear alignment between the partisanship of what they're saying and the partisanship of their audience. Once that's present, the information spread is easy regardless of the accuracy of the information.  That's the answer I'd give, but I also would like to caveat this by saying I'm no super sold on the whole point. I'm trying to find the actual survey and having little luck, but they discussed the self-reporting of preventative behavior (i.e. wearing a mask when going out) on a recent 538 Politics podcast and the gaps by partisanship weren't all that big. Honestly, I think most Republicans are taking this only slightly less seriously as Democrats and the article you linked to is anecdotal and overstating the real differences. Also, Leticia Bode makes the point that we should really think of the quality of information as a hierarchy rather than purely right or wrong. Because this disease is so new, there aren't real scientific consensus around anything. We don't know what the truth is regarding, well, just about anything having to do with COVID-19. We have well-informed guesses. Keeping some modicum of skepticism strikes me as what a reasonable person should do in this situation. Trust the experts, but don't assume they're infallible.","

They are paid to devise strategies and talking points with the aim of manipulating voters into believing things they otherwise wouldn't.  But the primary ""tool"" is our innate tendency towards tribalism.  Loyalty to the in-group. Disgust at the out-group. In-group members can be trusted. Out-group members cannot.  And to Fox News viewers, scientists are, generally speaking, out-group members.  Take climate change as an instructive example. As laid out in Merchants of Doubt, conservative think tanks recruited scientists to lie on their behalf. Fred Singer is a notable example. Not only did he publicly deny climate change, he also defended passive smoking and acid rain.  By presenting these scientists as noble ""traitors"" to their in-group, it also reinforces the idea that the rest of the scientists are part of the out-group ""cabal"".  By amplifying this innate tendency towards tribalism, you start seeing rapid polarization:  >For example, people selectively approach information that supports their tribe’s interests and avoid information that has potential to harm their tribe (by watching particular news networks, or by forming “echo chambers” in their social environments; Stroud, 2010). And people evaluate information they are exposed to in a biased manner by being uncritically accepting of information that supports their tribe’s agenda and more skeptical of information that opposes it (Ditto et al., 2018).   >   >Clark, C.

When out-group members attack these beliefs, they're only adding fuel to the fire.","

It’s  because the centrifugal force is a sort of bookkeeping notation, a made-up pseudoforce that we can use to describe orbital motion if the reference frame we choose is itself rotating. I guess the best explanatory example I can think of is:   imagine you’re looking up from your street at night and can see a geostationary satellite. From your perspective there, it’s just as unmoving as you are, and since you feel like you’re not moving, and the satellite seems like it’s not moving, you say “ah! Gravity must be pulling the satellite straight down, but it isn’t getting closer. There must be another thing called centrifugal force propping it up!”  When we choose another frame, maybe the one where the sun is stationary and we can see the earth turning and the satellite moving around in a big circle we can say “ah! The satellite tends to travel in a straight line, BUT the (single) force of gravity keeps pulling it down a bit so it curves around into a circle.”   In this frame, there’s no need to invoke a centrifugal force (that’s what people mean when they say the centrifugal force isn’t real, if you’ve ever heard that).

Orbit instability comes about more due to interactions between other additional masses in the system, or due to bumpiness and sloshy-ness of the bodies involved. For example, the earth is spinning under the moon and the flexing of the tides and the interior of the earth is making the planet “give away” some of its rotation speed to the moon, causing the moon to go faster in its orbit and therefore get farther away over time.","

Elliptical orbits are more general where the forces are sometimes unbalanced, however they are also stable and periodic","

Human: Is it impossible for an object to be in perfect orbit? So for an object to be in orbit, the gravitational force and centrifugal force have to perfectly balance out. Because it is virtually impossible for the two values to be *exactly* the same, does that mean that any objects in orbit will eventually drift away or collide (disregarding other causes of this)? If not, how is it possible for the forces to perfectly balance out so often?

Cats just happen to be more likely to possess that gene.    Heterochromia in cats starts when they are kittens. Kittens are born with blue eyes and their true eye colour only begins to show at around 7 to 12 weeks old when the amount of melanin in their eyes begins to change. When an adult cat has blue eyes it means there's an absence of melanin.  The gene that creates white fur stops the melanin from being able to reach one of the eyes during the kitten’s development. In cats who have heterochromia, the melanin doesn’t spread fully through one eye which leaves it partially blue.  As someone else pointed out, Huskies and Australian Shepherds also commonly have heterochromia. Why? Because those are two dog breeds that often have the gene for white fur.","

This has been evident for over a year. We know that Trump is a liar and a conman and his supporters chose him to make government more effective. This strange decision is the result of poor education, misleading media and willful ignorance that will not change anytime soon.  Trump could continue to make mistakes, say controversial things, fail to pass changes to immigration or healthcare and pass a normal Republican budget. He could oversee a damaged economy and failing international security situation. He could make no major changes to the US government aside from embarrassing it and weakening the country but his supporters will continue to support him no matter what.  Most people in most western countries seem aware of Trump's failings but Republicans, for whatever reason, are not.

They are heavily insulated and fed mountains of propaganda from conservative talk radio and Fox News.  To reach Trump supporters, you have to find a way to penetrate that sphere. To break into that target audience with liberal or moderate media. Once you do that, it's easy to sell the working class a method that a bunch of rich jackasses rigged the system to make it harder for you to get rich yourself.  The Dem message, for the most part, can work with the right wrapping paper. But the key is finding a vehicle to bring it to the Right.  In order to crush Trump's support group, the Left needs to gain a foothold in talk radio. That is an absolute MUST. Most places have no liberal talk radio or if they do it's on an obscure station. No more. Liberal networks need to do what Sinclair Media has been doing and others have been doing on the Rght and make huge media buys, putting Left-leaning hosts on popular local frequencies. That is the most important, because it gets to people on their daily commute hearing liberal talking points.   It's insane that Chicago has 2, soon to be 3 conservative talk stations and only one liberal one, which is difficult to pick up in a lot of places.   Next is finding a way to de-legitimize Fox News in their eyes, and make liberal stations appealing to conservatives. Maybe that means bombastic personality types, I'm not a media expert.   Trump's base can be destroyed, but only by breaking into their sphere of influence","

If something can be dormant for 14 days, then in a house of 3 people you could potentially have someone catch it right before they go in, transmit it to another person on the 14th day, then they transmit it to the 3rd person on their 14th day (28th overall) and then you're right at the end of your month isolation with a freshly infected case.

I follow a bunch of science groups, and a few months ago I remember someone posting a video of a mother explaining why she wasn't vaccinating her kids (i wish I could find it but I can't so far). Immediately the post was filled with ""enlightened"" people mocking, belittling her, and saying she should lose her children. When I watched the video, though, the mothers reason was understandable- the doctor was giving the child way too many vaccines at once and not spacing them out as recommended practice, and shamed the mother when she asked about it.   We need to ask ourselves: how can we make these well-intended parents trust the medical system? Blackmailing them (which your proposal will come off as) won't be effective.   Also, I dated someone who was raised un-vacinated and anti-vax in general. He was indigenous, and his family did not want to be forced by the government to do anything, especially with the gov's history in their community of medical experimentation, forced sterilization and residential schooling. There are communities with extremely legitimate fears of the western medical system- and we need to recognize that.","

Human: CMV: Child Protective Services in the US should treat the willful failure to vaccinate your children the same way it treats a failure to keep your home in a habitable condition--the kids should be placed with relatives until the situation is resolved. I worked with children during an internship in the field of social services, and I have seen many parents lose their kids because their homes are so filthy the children's health is at risk. Yet we don't do the same when we know the parent is refusing to vaccinate their children for non-medical or non-financial reasons. Taking kids away from their parents is an extreme measure, so I understand that the courts won't do so lightly. I just don't see how one is worse than the other.  It would be interesting to know your arguments for and against getting CPS involved for failure to vaccinate.

Depending on how much you want to make (I used to make the shit 25 onions at a time) just french an onion get your saute pan out over high heat. I never used butter just some good high heat oil, you don't need a ton of oil just enough to get a good coat with maybe a little extra. Let it get quite literally smoking hot. Once you are at this point toss those onions in and let it cook for a second before you start moving it. The main ideas here are a few things, first don't overload your pan if you put to much what you basically do is steam your onions with the moisture that is released. Second let the damn things cook you don't have to be constantly moving them, you want some color to develop and those natural sugars to start to release in the liquid (hence caramelization). After about 10-15 minutes (less for smaller batches) of stirring and you should have some really good color starting and your onions should be cooked. Here's where it gets tempting to dump it out but DON'T you see all that nice dark color on the bottom of the pan that's the sweet sugary goodness you want. Turn off the head and cover with a tight lid for about 5-10 minutes, the moisture still being released will condense on your lid, and drip down deglazing all that sugar, give it a good stir to get all that fond off and BOOM heaven made from onions, easy as pie.  Main point is let them onion cook, if you are constantly stirring all you are doing is just letting your pan cool and no real color develop. If you do overload the pan, there's a fix for that but it is a bit more difficult and basically involves a controlled burning, in that you let the onions on the bottom cook through and start to darken then stir. Then let that layer darken, then stir, repeat till color is achieved that like before, a good tight fitting lid and take it off heat  edit: the reason I don't use butter is typical store bought butter had ""solids"" and filler in it that are going to burn and it has a relatively low heat tolerance","

Just to flag up an interpretive issue: one active topic is on whether to read the Tractatus as meaningful or not. That sounds weird, and it is weird. Basically, at the end, the book says that if you understand, then you also see that the whole book is nonsense. This claim is the basis for two whole schools of thought on how to read the book as a whole. One school, the received view, is that he doesn't really mean 'nonesense' like blahblahblah. He means that the language is unclear in a certain way. The other school, the resolute view, is that he really means nonsense. So you come to the book at first thinking that it is meaningful, but in reading the what you think are meaningful sentences according to your mistaken belief in their meaning, you change. You end up realizing that you were wrong, this sort of language seems meaningful but is total nonsense. Somehow W was able to arrange the nonsense to short circuit your mistaken belief and let you see the mistake. Anyway, the received view started when the book was published and almost everyone is part of this school. Cora Diamond started the resolute view (I think that's right, I'm not going to go look it all up). Jim Conant jumped on in a big way. You'll want to look at The Realistic Spirit by Diamond and Jim's webpage for his string of papers on this. I'm sure there's more new stuff on it too, but I haven't looked at this debate in a very long time.","

The overall bake time will be shorter, but I can't give you an exact one, you just need to watch it until it reaches the right stage, which is described explicitly in Step 8 near the end of the recipe below. Even if you don't use this recipe, those ""doneness"" instructions are useful. Also, you'll get the best texture from your crust if you time your work so that the crust and the filling are both hot when you pour the filling into the crust, then immediately put them into the oven.  I'm offering you what is in my opinion the best pecan pie recipe ever written (not by me). It contains NO corn syrup, which can cause an icky, gloppy texture. Instead, it uses maple syrup, which remains velvety and soft and supplies an unbelievable flavor. The cooking time in this recipe is really different from most, because it uses a lower temperature (sorry about the Farenheit but it should be easy to convert). The lower temp also contributes to smooth texture and no ""eggy"" overtones. Just don't forget to lower the oven temp per the instructions after blind baking the crusts, because you wouldn't want to bake the filling at the higher temp.  I've seen people who hated pecan pie (because of the corn syrup) converted by this version of it. The flavor is incredible. If you can't get maple syrup over there, then yeah, the Chef John version is probably a good one because of the reduced amount of corn syrup. This recipe contains a pie crust recipe, but if you have your own crust recipe that you prefer, just go with that and roll it out, blind bake it and fill it hot as per the instructions here.   And happy holidays to you!  MAPLE PECAN PIE    Serves 8.      If you want warm pie, cool the pie thoroughly, then cut and warm it in a 250-degree oven for about twenty minutes. More liquid than corn syrup, maple syrup yields a softer, more custardlike pie.       INGREDIENTS   Pie Shell:   1 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus extra for dough and rolling surface   2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar    1/2 teaspoon table salt    8 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled, cut into 1/4 -inch pieces   2 tablespoons vegetable shortening, frozen, cut into small pieces   1 large egg white, chilled, thoroughly mixed with ice water (about 2 tablespoons) to equal 1/4 cup   1 large egg yolk, beaten with 1/8 teaspoon water      INSTRUCTIONS   1. For Pie Crust: Mix flour, sugar, and salt in food processor fitted with steel blade. Scatter butter and shortening over dry ingredients and pulse until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, 10 to 15 seconds. Turn mixture into medium bowl.   2. Sprinkle egg white mixture over flour mixture and, with blade of rubber spatula, use folding motion to mix. Press down on dough with broad side of spatula until dough sticks together. Shape dough into ball with hands, then flatten into 4-inch disk. Dust dough lightly with flour, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and place in refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.   3. Roll dough on lightly floured surface into 13-inch circle and transfer to 9-inch pie pan, preferably glass. Press dough into corners and sides of pan, being careful not to stretch dough. Trim edges of dough to make 1/2-inch overhang. Tuck over-hanging dough under so that folded edge is flush with rim of pan. Flute edge (illustration 1).   4. Chill shell until firm, about 1 hour. Prick sides and bottom with fork and line entire shell with heavy-duty aluminum foil, pressing foil firmly against shell and extending it over fluted rim, (illustration 2). Prick foil with fork (illustration 3) and return shell to refrigerator while oven is heating.    5. Adjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Bake, pressing once or twice with mitt-protected hands, if necessary, to flatten any puffing, until crust is firmly set, about 15 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until bottom begins to color, about 10 minutes longer. Remove from oven, brush sides and bottom with egg yolk, and return to oven until yolk glazes over, about 1 minute longer. Remove from oven, and set aside while preparing the filling.   6. Lower oven temperature to 275 degrees. Place pie shell in oven if not still warm.      Filling   4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces   1/2 cup granulated sugar    1/4 teaspoon table salt    3 large eggs    1 cup maple syrup, pure, preferably Grade B or Grade A dark amber   1 1/2 cups whole pecans (6 ounces), toasted and chopped into small pieces      INSTRUCTIONS   7. For Pie: Melt butter in medium heatproof bowl set in skillet of water maintained at just below simmer. Remove bowl from skillet; mix in sugar and salt with wooden spoon until butter is absorbed. Beat in eggs, then maple syrup. Return bowl to hot water; stir until mixture is shiny and warm to the touch, about 130 degrees. Remove from heat; stir in pecans.   8. Pour mixture into warm shell; bake until center feels set yet soft, like gelatin, when gently pressed, 50 to 60 minutes. Transfer pie to rack; let cool completely, at least 4 hours. Serve pie at room temperature or warm, with lightly sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.","

Monarchs for ages have had arranged marriages for their children so that they can create political alliances. When the Duke next door happens to also be your Son in Law it's a lot more likely you'll be able to count on him for support.  Queen Victoria had 9 children (not unusual for the time) and arranged for them to be married into the royal families of Europe in order to create such alliances. This wasn't unique to her, medieval monarchs had been doing that sort of thing since antiquity.  Queen Victoria's case wasn't unique but it was unusual because of just how many powerful royal families in Europe she was able to marry her kids into. The British Empire was at its height at the time and other royal families were keen to make alliances with Britain.  This kind of backfired though, WW1 in a sense was the war of the cousins. The monarchs of the most powerful nations at the time Czar Nicholas II, Kaiser Wilhelm, and King George V were all cousins. In fact if you look at their pictures side by side there is a remarkable similarity in appearance between them.  The problem became that Nicholas and Wilhelm in particular were incompetent rulers and functionally ended the monarchies in their nations when they were deposed. The great irony of Queen Victoria is that she tried to unite Europe under single family but actually ended up ending the monarchy across Europe within a single generation due to the incompetence of her own Grandchildren. Within a decade the turmoil caused by the war would see those same nations end up under the Communists and Nazi's.","

The most common one, in my experience, is that you finish off your own paper.  > as first author, is this still your responsibility if you no longer work for those PIs  I find this a bit of an odd perspective.  The responsibility derives from the fact that you are first author: it is *your* paper, about *your* work.  None of that depends on who is paying your salary.  If you've left research and don't mind burning some bridges then sure, you can refuse to work on it and the professional ramifications will be fairly limited.

The reason for this type of lateralization of function is theorized to actually be quite simple: you can cram more functions into a smaller area if you have the two adjacent hemispheres do related but non-identical types of processing.   Breaking bi-symmetry in this way is a beautiful evolutionary mechanism and is extraordinarily complex in terms of the genetic mechanisms that result in asymmetry. Look up homeobox genes to get an idea of how this all plays out during embryological development. Its simply miraculous that this happens every time a human being is born.  If you look up pictures of a mouse or rat brain you'll see that there is some 'dividedness' but it is not nearly as prevalent as in primates.  Norman Geschwind did some amazing studies on patients with their corpus callosum severed (the bundle of fiber tracts connecting both hemispheres) and it really gives one an idea of how competent both hemispheres are individually. Octopuses actually have a set up similar to this; each of their 8 arms contains a ganglion that is essentially a mini-brain that is part independent and part controlled by the central 'big brain'. Its fascinating that this segregation of neural processing took such an extreme evolutionary route in these creatures but considering the extreme intelligence that they are said to possess it is not surprising that having distinct neural processing nodes is more advantageous that one large amorphous blob of gray matter.","

Human: Why is the brain divided? * A search doesn't reveal anything that answers this question specifically.  * Yes, I know that many of the left brain/right brain claims are false.  * Essentially I'm asking about the cerebrum's longitudinal fissure--why would such a feature be selected for? Doesn't it waste space that could be used for more brain? Is there a benefit from inhibited interhemispheric communication?  * And what about non-human animals--are their brains divided too? How long ago did this feature arise?

Yes, all animals with brains have bilateral structures. Even animals like worms and insects that we don't necessarily refer to as having ""brains"" but rather collections of neurons known as ganglia have bilaterality of their neurons.   Look up images of comparisons of brains across the different animal groups. There are clear differences, but overall a lot of similarities in the overall structures present.","

Without knowing the details, like what symptom led you to taking your car to the dealership, I can give you my two cents.   Say you had a check engine light, that came along with a drivability concern. Me as the technician would first look at fault codes and see which of the computers registered a fault. Multiple computers can turn on the check engine light for different reasons. Once I have that basic information I can start a diagnosis. In your case: typically, a bad fuel pump will not set a fault code unless you have a high pressure fuel system. Now if I had to guess, the reason they thought intake and then fuel supply, I would bet money there was some kind of mixture formation fault. So if there’s four fault codes it is possible you have more than one issue. A drivability concern that may or may not go noticed and a check engine light. This doesn’t happen often, but it does happen. From the dealership’s perspective, they thought they had a solution and made a recommendation. I would have addressed everything at once. If you had two faults related to mixture formation it is possible you have a leak in the intake. A good mechanic would have checked that before sending an estimate and verified that is indeed a problem. After that I would look at the other fault codes and see if they could be related or sympathetic to the other ones. If not, probably a separate problem.   It’s just odd that they gave you the option for more diagnostic labor or a repair. Should have just been the one option for more diagnostic labor. Then I could say yes, this is bad and so is this. This happens at almost every dealership unfortunately but I can tell you that we would have eaten the intake job if it didn’t fix any of your concerns, or at least offer a split if your car did in fact need it, plus a fuel pump. It sounds like you had a combination of bad advisor and bad technician. I would be persistent in fighting this because it’s the right thing to do on their part. The whole reason people bring their cars to the dealership for service is they have confidence that since it is our product that we work on exclusively, we will fix the car without fail. They did not live up to that, plain and simple.","

Back in my early twenties I was a promoter for concerts and raves. I had friends in almost every Sydney scene: ravers, goths, scene kids, club kids, surfers, the nascent indie/hipster scene, activists, fledgling yuppies and suits, the down and outs, druggies, with the occasional bogan or dropkick to boot.  I was also struggling with undiagnosed bipolar II disorder and depression.  While I was out and about, which was frequently (my income depended on it) I was the life of the party. I was known by everyone, often before I'd even met them. Everyone was my best friend, or acted like it to try and get a good deal or a good time. My public face was a pretty friendly and flirtatious one. Everyone knew that I'd be right next to the cute girls at whatever party I was at, exchanging numbers, dancing, more intimate activities...  Everyone knew that I was busy sleeping my way around Sydney. Everyone was wrong. I was still broken up from an old relationship, I never went home with anyone, I always had plausible excuses to leave early (there's always another party, after all.)  I'd make my excuses, I'd leave alone, I'd wander home, and I'd sit in the dark, trying to distract myself from my darker urges or having a cigarette on the balcony while I thought about ways to kill myself.  Eventually, that stage of my life ended. Life has gotten better in some ways, worse in others. Putting on the public face is exhausting, especially due to the fact that I don't really *get* people, I just love being close to this confusing swirl of emotion that I don't understand.  What I'm getting at is that once you have the public face set up it's pretty easy to just let the legend take off. All you have to do is show up at a party every so often, make up a few stories about your latest escapades and everyone else will take care of the rest. It's exhausting, it's fake, and I don't envy the life of Batman, even though he's completely fictional.  TL;DR I'm Batman's alter-ego. I'm the poor man's Bruce Wayne, or at least I was once upon a time.","

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.

She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case.

But it's getting harder and harder each time.

So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

rejected,-562.1621704101562,-539.7706909179688,-2.239147901535034,156," I wonder if the not sitting on the toilet seat is causing some of the problems.  Her body might not be able to evacuate properly, so having a knock on effect to the problem.  I vaguely remember something about putting toilet paper around the seat encourages bacteria.  Maybe after each use, use a anti bac bathroom wipe on the seat.  So she has peace of mind there.  Also when booking a gp appointment request a double appointment slot.  Then you have more time to discuss it, also write all symptoms down as a cue sheet for you.  I know with my health issues my doctor is happier to see that I have it written down than me saying I know there is something else but cannot remember.  Good luck, hope you find an answer","

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.

I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom.

And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.

Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system.

This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.

She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.

rejected,-562.1621704101562,-539.5433349609375,-2.261883497238159,156," I wonder if the not sitting on the toilet seat is causing some of the problems.  Her body might not be able to evacuate properly, so having a knock on effect to the problem.  I vaguely remember something about putting toilet paper around the seat encourages bacteria.  Maybe after each use, use a anti bac bathroom wipe on the seat.  So she has peace of mind there.  Also when booking a gp appointment request a double appointment slot.  Then you have more time to discuss it, also write all symptoms down as a cue sheet for you.  I know with my health issues my doctor is happier to see that I have it written down than me saying I know there is something else but cannot remember.  Good luck, hope you find an answer","

And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together.

Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system.

This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.

One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

The doc told me to stop using wet wipes as they can cause micro tears on all that sensitive skin (which it was, very burn-y). Ended up with hemorrhoids for awhile, eventually had a fissure that eventually turned into an abscess with a fistula. I say all this because at the fistula stage I had all sorts of weird discharge happening, plus extreme fatigue. It didn’t really hurt at that point (until I had surgery, but it got better).   See the doctor, keep a food diary—mine had me follow the FOD-MAP chart to see if that helped. Stay hydrated for sure. Good luck, I hope you all find a solution soon.","

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.

She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.

She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.

In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far.

They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

rejected,-562.1621704101562,-539.7706298828125,-2.239154100418091,156," I wonder if the not sitting on the toilet seat is causing some of the problems.  Her body might not be able to evacuate properly, so having a knock on effect to the problem.  I vaguely remember something about putting toilet paper around the seat encourages bacteria.  Maybe after each use, use a anti bac bathroom wipe on the seat.  So she has peace of mind there.  Also when booking a gp appointment request a double appointment slot.  Then you have more time to discuss it, also write all symptoms down as a cue sheet for you.  I know with my health issues my doctor is happier to see that I have it written down than me saying I know there is something else but cannot remember.  Good luck, hope you find an answer","

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.

However, psychological issues such as anxiety - particularly health anxiety - very commonly manifest all sorts of physical symptoms. Please don’t underestimate this, or what it can create within your body. Continue pursuing physical doctors by all means, but please also look at getting her CBT. It’s been instrumental for me in getting over my health anxiety and the physical symptoms that come with it.","

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.

What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.

rejected,-562.1621704101562,-539.741943359375,-2.242022752761841,156," I wonder if the not sitting on the toilet seat is causing some of the problems.  Her body might not be able to evacuate properly, so having a knock on effect to the problem.  I vaguely remember something about putting toilet paper around the seat encourages bacteria.  Maybe after each use, use a anti bac bathroom wipe on the seat.  So she has peace of mind there.  Also when booking a gp appointment request a double appointment slot.  Then you have more time to discuss it, also write all symptoms down as a cue sheet for you.  I know with my health issues my doctor is happier to see that I have it written down than me saying I know there is something else but cannot remember.  Good luck, hope you find an answer","

Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.

In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.

You can buy soluble fibre to add to the diet too if you think that will help. As for fluids, there's no excuse for that - there's plenty of water in the tap.  You might want to cut back on the wiping, it must be damaging to be constantly rubbing down there, she might want to try actually bathing after going to the toilet (look up hip bath).

It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem.

This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample.

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.

Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.

We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense.

I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

Assistant:"
rejected,-562.1621704101562,-539.7706909179688,-2.239147901535034,156," I wonder if the not sitting on the toilet seat is causing some of the problems.  Her body might not be able to evacuate properly, so having a knock on effect to the problem.  I vaguely remember something about putting toilet paper around the seat encourages bacteria.  Maybe after each use, use a anti bac bathroom wipe on the seat.  So she has peace of mind there.  Also when booking a gp appointment request a double appointment slot.  Then you have more time to discuss it, also write all symptoms down as a cue sheet for you.  I know with my health issues my doctor is happier to see that I have it written down than me saying I know there is something else but cannot remember.  Good luck, hope you find an answer","

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories.

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

chosen,-562.1621704101562,-539.7706909179688,-2.239147901535034,156," I wonder if the not sitting on the toilet seat is causing some of the problems.  Her body might not be able to evacuate properly, so having a knock on effect to the problem.  I vaguely remember something about putting toilet paper around the seat encourages bacteria.  Maybe after each use, use a anti bac bathroom wipe on the seat.  So she has peace of mind there.  Also when booking a gp appointment request a double appointment slot.  Then you have more time to discuss it, also write all symptoms down as a cue sheet for you.  I know with my health issues my doctor is happier to see that I have it written down than me saying I know there is something else but cannot remember.  Good luck, hope you find an answer","

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.

So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

If the particles are microscopic how can you see them? Are you sure there's not an anxiety/psychological element to this?  The scope can only go so far without doing damage, it was probably a sigmoidoscopy? Anyway if she was impacted it would have saw that or sent her to A&E when she took the Kleen-prep.  If she's eating rubbish and not drinking enough then why aren't you doing anything about it? Your super market might not sell Romanian goods but it definitely sells fresh meat, cheese, veg and pulses. Cook books and YouTube will tell you what to do with these, no point saying your diet is crap and not doing anything about it. You can buy soluble fibre to add to the diet too if you think that will help. As for fluids, there's no excuse for that - there's plenty of water in the tap.  You might want to cut back on the wiping, it must be damaging to be constantly rubbing down there, she might want to try actually bathing after going to the toilet (look up hip bath).   You need to double book a GP appointment and explain everything that's going on, including the 3 hour marathon cleaning sessions to get a picture of what's going on here.","

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.

I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom.

It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on.

Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

I'm merely dropping ideas that came to mind due to things I've read, experienced, and worked around.    I know that the suggestions of psychological issues being present can be offensive and feel condescending. Here's the thing to remember, though- she has physical symptoms. My uneducated but observant mind thinks something is wrong but it may be a much smaller issue than it seems, and that I would guess is due to OCD-type issues and/or anxiety.    I would guess that she does have some kind of IBD. My first colonoscopy did not detect my Ulcerative Colitis so, sometimes, one test isn't enough. It can cause mucus-only restroom visits. And, as a previous person said, she may have fecal incontinence. What brings that into question for me, though, is that you said she ALSO has urinary incontinence problems.    Again, I'm just guessing here, but if she already had some OCD-type tendencies or anxiety before, her becoming so uncomfortable with bathroom visits at your older residence may have been the tipping point. Combine that with all the bad things she now associates with going to the bathroom, any normal person would develop avoidance behavior. Bad. Very bluntly, if she sometimes pees herself because she waits so long to go (likely due to dreading how long she knows it will take after), she must do it with #2, as well. If she's going #2 the normal amount of times, it's not normal. Because if she's holding it for a long time every time, no one knows what her normal stool is.    I respect you and I respect her. It sounds like she's having a real battle and she's a real warrior. Nothing about it is ""not real"". Fear does crazy stuff to us, though. I promise I have been there with another condition. Many have. With bathroom issues, though, what can start out as a problem can get much worse if that anxiety builds. Avoidance makes everything worse. Unfortunately, I don't know how much a doctor can help until you guys can see what problems exist in the absence of avoidance.    The particles she's talking about that you can't see? I'm about to get real blunt and gross here. Imagine constantly thinking about butt problems, clinching your butt cheeks all day, especially when you're trying to hold it. Mix that with probable IBD issues, and that makes for... a gross stew of cursed butt sweat. Here in the US, it's called swamp ass. Those particles she's mentioning is probably sweat mixed with a tiny bit of discharge/ minuscule amount of stool. She sees slight discoloration when she wipes and all the way up the crack.    You sound like an amazing partner and confidante, but everyone could do with more professional, psychological help when going through hard times. She CAN lead a fulfilling life that's more than what she's currently experiencing, but it'll take some bravery on her part. I am sure you guys can get through it. Best of luck.","

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.

The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...""exits"", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?

At least her blood sugar should be tested to rule that out as well. Glucometers are cheap, or a doctor could do it.","

Human: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.

chosen,-758.598876953125,-756.3676147460938,-0.22312621772289276,375," Most of the votes that take place in Democracy are winner takes all because the alternative is simply impractical. Let's use the example of a local election, such as voting for a mayor, or police chief. There is precisely one office to fill, and so the winner is whoever gets the most votes. Depending on your voting system, this will either be a FPTP system (highest individual total wins), or some form of run-off where the least popular candidate is struck and then secondary choices of his voters are applied, then the process repeats until someone has a majority (above 50%).  This means that there is no way to sensibly split the results without creating government bloat. In order for people's votes to ""not be wasted"", you would effectively need every office to have a committee of 3-5 (or more) equally-ranked people, filled proportional to the votes cast. This would not make society better - it would simply waste tax money and see that nothing is ever accomplished.  Moreover, any politician or elected official who isn't utterly stupid will pay attention to the elections that got them into power. If you win by the narrowest of margins, you will be fully aware that margin might disappear next election. This is why you find the most moderate candidates in 'swing' counties / districts / states, and the very worst candidates in safe seats. The former know they have to appeal to their rivals' voters if they want to maintain office, the latter know the sheep will keep them in power no matter how corrupt they are.  So you absolutely do have a voice, even if your candidate loses. If you find yourself in an absolute minority position where your chosen candidates are being utterly destroyed consistently, that isn't proof democracy is broken - it's proof you hold views completely out of alignment with your community, for better or worse.","

Human: CMV: In a Representative Democracy, there should be no Winning or Losing in Elections. So, it is often taken for granted that the US (I will be using the US for this post, but this can be applied to any representative ""democratic"" body) that we have representative democracy.  We do not.  **If you ""vote"" for a candidate in a representative body that loses their election, you have no voice in our democracy.**  In order to give people true voices in their politics, we should move to affirmational representation.  This would mean the following:  1. Elections are just periods in which you can select your representative. 2. Any representative is now a member of that body representing  and casting X # of votes. 3. For ease of discussion and debate (US House of Reps example) only the top 435 representatives sit in the house for debate.  Others can cast votes, but not debate.  4. Voting inside the body will thus be based on total votes.  For example, you may need 150,000,000+ votes to pass a bill in the House of Reps in the United States. 5. Non-voters could be considered ""okay with any"" and their representation could be split proportionally amongst all eligible. 6.

Do you pay all their expenses to be able to be full-time representatives (listen to all the debates in the parliament, go to all the votes, etc.)? If yes, this will make the political system extremely expensive. People will also misuse it. They will set themselves up for being a representative and then just vote for themselves, voila, they are now a ""representative"" with a cushy job in the capital.  If not, but instead you set some vote threshold that the candidates have to get before becoming a representative, then your basis idea gets trashed and all the good things about it go down in drain as then there will be people without representation.  Most of the problems you can fix by using a proportional voting system. If you elect the 435 (or whatever) representatives so that their proportions in the parliament represents the number of votes their party got in the election and the people from the party who get to be the representatives, are those who got the most votes in that party, then you get pretty much all the benefits of your system. You won't have a person as your representative, but a combination of the party and the person In the next election you can vote the same party's different candidate or a different party altogether.  edit. In principle you could modify the proportional system towards your system so that everyone's vote is recorded in the system (but kept secret). Any day you like, you walk to the voting place of your city and say that you want to change your vote. At that point one vote is deducted from the party that you voted before and given to some other party. If this forces a change in the parliament, then one MP there is fired and a new one takes his/her place. So, you can change your ""representative"" whenever you like and there's no need for any set elections. The government just naturally collapses and a new takes its place, when enough voters have changed their mind.","

The representative represents the people of a geographical area, not just the people that voted for them. That representative may not cast a vote in the legislature as you would, but they still represent you. It seems like this could still occur in the system that you propose.  It isn't very obvious what benefits your system offers over the existing system or other alternatives.   The representatives aren't bound to vote the same way as each voter would prefer. It seems like the obvious thing for each person to do to ensure that this doesn't happen would be nominate themselves as their representative, which would essentially be direct democracy with proxy voting.   If your complaint is that votes cast for losing candidates are effectively erased, a system with proportional representation would probably be simpler and has more real-world precidents.  What does your system of essentially transferable votes offer that makes it better?","

Each shell can hold 2n^(2) electrons.  This formula arises because electrons are fermions (particles with half-integer spin) and fermions are required to occupy distinct quantum states.  Electrons in atoms have four separate quantum numbers that can take different integer values, with the allowed ranges of some quantum numbers determined by the value of others.

For each n there are a set of other possible quantum numbers (these numbers describe certain properties of the electrons) that must be within certain ranges (which are dictated by the value of n or another quantum number, although ultimately they all indirectly depend on n) and each electron can only have one particular configuration of those numbers (groups of these numbers are called subshells).   So that limits how many electrons can be in a shell, there can only be as many electrons as the subshells can hold and thus as many available choices of quantum numbers. But you can make n as big as you want and if you add enough electrons you can get higher and higher numbers and so add more and more electrons to each shell.  The reason we only see a maximum of 18 for atoms we see commonly in the world around us (though not all natural atoms) is that they don't have enough electrons to reach these higher principal numbers because electrons repel each other and the reason there's a maximum for natural atoms is big enough atoms become unstable. Also generally it's more energetically favourable, i.e it takes less energy, to fill higher up low subshells, like 5s, than it does to fill lower down high subshells, like 4f, for a lot of reasons. For example it's more favourable to have a full higher subshell than a half full lower one.   If you look at carbon for example it has 12 electrons, so if it just went in order it would have it's electron configuration as 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 2d^2, because those are the first 12 available slots for electrons with the lowest possible n. However if you check you'll see that carbon has an electron configuration of 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2.","

Crash course does a pretty decent video about it (The Electron: Crash Course Chemistry #5). I'll give it a shot assuming you're in early high school and just learning this stuff for the first time.  Every time we get to a new noble gas, the periodic table starts to repeat its properties. In the early days, this was taken as evidence that we had reached a new valence shell which shielded the previous shells. The evidence came from the energy levels of the electrons that were added or taken away from the atoms.  As scientists got better at studying the atom, a pattern emerged: in the first shell, both electrons had the same energy, but in the second and third ""shells"", two electrons had a lower energy than the other six.  This led to subshell theory. There are 4 subshells, which can hold (in order) 2, 6, 10, and 14 electrons. There are further subshells (that pattern continues), but they are not commonly observed in everyday atoms or molecules.  So where does 2, 8, 8, 18, 18 come from? Well the first shell can only have the first subshell (2 electrons), but the second can have the first and second (2 + 6 = 8). The third technically has all three subshells (2 + 6 + 10 = 18), but as you get higher in energy the shells start to get closer to each other so the first two electrons in the fourth shell kind of sneak in before the last ten in the third shell.  Those first two electrons make a big spherical bubble around the atom, shielding the subshells beneath them, so that's where the periodic table restarts. That's why the third row of the table only has 8 elements. The other 10 electrons are only used in the 4th row (mind you, having those subshells available does change the chemistry of the atoms, making molecules like POCl3 possible).  To answer your initial question, 18 is not the limit, even in the old school periodic table. The 6th and 7th row already contain 32 elements (2 + 6 + 10 + 14) and theoretically the next row would have 50!","

Then with no regards to the earholes of those below Mr. Meechum floors it and takes the Raptor supersonic.  The afterburner lights up as additional fuel is injected into the jet exhaust.

So we've got logistics down, now lets do some math.  Using a ICAO standard atmosphere calculator yields a speed of 1188 mph for our heros at mach 1.8 at 60,000ft.     Next the Raptor can carry 18,000 lbs of fuel and the KC-135 can dispense up to 6,500 per minute.  That gives us about 3 minutes to refuel assuming they are carrying some reserves.  Which means at 530 mph they will cover **26.5** miles each refuel.  So:    | Quick Maffs ---|--- **Recent Action**| **Total Distance Travel** Leg 1 | 900 Re-Fuel 1 | 926.5 Leg 2 | 1826.5 Re-Fuel 2 | 1853 Leg 3 | 2753 Re-Fuel 3 | 2779.5 Leg 4 |3662 (in Washington DC.)

So how long would all this take?  900 miles at 1188 mph is .76 hours or **45.6 minutes.**   The last (slightly shorter) leg  would take .74 hours or **44.4 minutes**  As stated above each refuel is 3 minutes.  Adding it all up:  45.6(x3) + 44.4(x1) + 3(x3) = 190.2 minutes or   **2 hours 40 minutes and 12 seconds**  from wheels up to wheels down.","

I'm going to go with the head of state scenario to make things a bit more interesting (you'll see why in a second).  Lets say the POTUS is in London and needs to get back to Washington DC ASAP.  That will be our baseline.  One might recall that Air Force One is not the only plane that travels with the POTUS when he goes abroad.  C-17 and a handful of fighters typically follow.  This time it is 4 F-22 Raptors.  Perfect, the POTUS can just commundeer one and be home in no time, right?  Wrong, the only problem is our POTUS is not a pilot.  Fear not.  His trusty secret service agent Edward Meechum was a pilot in the Air Force.  He can get the President to the White House!  The Brits are kind enough to top off the Raptor with a tank of JP-8 jetfuel and off they go! **** Now heres where I break the fourth wall and draw you out of my little narrative.  The reason we chose the F-22 Raptor and not say the F-16 or F-15 was for two reasons:  1:  It has two seats instead of one.  2: It has the ability to supercruise (meaning sustained supersonic flight).  Most other fighters are only capable of relatively short dashes before they deplete fuel reserves.   Anyway on we go: **** Now Mr. President and Mr. Meechum take-off, climb, and turn west.  Then with no regards to the earholes of those below Mr. Meechum floors it and takes the Raptor supersonic.  The afterburner lights up as additional fuel is injected into the jet exhaust.  The F-22 shoots up to speed at Mach 1.8 (maximum speed for supercruise).  By now, dear readers I'm sure you have realized the impending doom of our heros as they run out of fuel over the ocean.  After all the range of the F-22 at supercruise is a measly 900 miles and they need to travel 3662 miles!  But fear not!  NATO has arraigned for a few friendly KC-135 stratotankers to provide a pitstop in the sky!  Just remember that the Raptor has to slow down to refuel as our KC-135s can only cruise at 530 mph.  So we've got logistics down, now lets do some math.  Using a ICAO standard atmosphere calculator yields a speed of 1188 mph for our heros at mach 1.8 at 60,000ft.     Next the Raptor can carry 18,000 lbs of fuel and the KC-135 can dispense up to 6,500 per minute.  That gives us about 3 minutes to refuel assuming they are carrying some reserves.  Which means at 530 mph they will cover **26.5** miles each refuel.

Human: Why does my lobster taste fishy? I have eaten lobster twice. The first time was at a restaurant; the lobster was frozen and cooked in the smoker. It was a drastic improvement over shrimp and noticeably sweeter with no fishy taste at all.

It was more tender than the one from the restaurant but was less sweet with a noticeable fishy taste. The two lobster were approximately of the same  size.  The only thing that I may have done wrong is that I used a heaping teaspoon of salt per quart. Note: in the restaurant the lobster was served whole and I was the one who extracted the meat out of the shell, so I ruled out the possibility that the restaurant had any impact on the taste of the lobster other than the smoking.

According to the [World Health Organization, there are approximately 1 million new infections daily worldwide, resulting in 2.3 million deaths every year. In the United States, half of new STIs occur among those ages 15-24. Meanwhile, increases in antimicrobial resistance are making it harder to treat and cure infections. STIs also represent a massive burden to the economy- in the United States alone, $16 billion is spent annually on STI-related health care costs.  But it's not all bad news! Screening programs are increasing around the world, mother to child transmission rates of diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis and HIV are decreasing, and effective treatments are continuing to be developed and delivered to patients in need. Even better, new technologies, some of which were created rapidly as part of the national COVID-19 response effort, are making it easier for people to access routine sexual health maintenance services.

Human: AskScience AMA Series: We're Experts Here to Discuss Sexually Transmitted Infections. AUA! Let's talk about sex(ually transmitted infections STIs])! We'll be here today at 2 PM ET for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), about the present and future of STIs.  STIs are an enormous health issue. According to the [World Health Organization, there are approximately 1 million new infections daily worldwide, resulting in 2.3 million deaths every year. In the United States, half of new STIs occur among those ages 15-24. Meanwhile, increases in antimicrobial resistance are making it harder to treat and cure infections. STIs also represent a massive burden to the economy- in the United States alone, $16 billion is spent annually on STI-related health care costs.  But it's not all bad news! Screening programs are increasing around the world, mother to child transmission rates of diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis and HIV are decreasing, and effective treatments are continuing to be developed and delivered to patients in need. Even better, new technologies, some of which were created rapidly as part of the national COVID-19 response effort, are making it easier for people to access routine sexual health maintenance services.  We're here to answer your questions and discuss causes and cures, as well as opportunities for improvements in diagnoses and prevention strategies. We'll also discuss the emergence of new diseases and how they can be contained.  PLEASE NOTE- WE WILL NOT BE MAKING PERSONAL DIAGNOSES OR RECOMMENDING TREATMENTS.

Human: AskScience AMA Series: We're Experts Here to Discuss Sexually Transmitted Infections. AUA! Let's talk about sex(ually transmitted infections STIs])! We'll be here today at 2 PM ET for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), about the present and future of STIs.  STIs are an enormous health issue. According to the [World Health Organization, there are approximately 1 million new infections daily worldwide, resulting in 2.3 million deaths every year. In the United States, half of new STIs occur among those ages 15-24. Meanwhile, increases in antimicrobial resistance are making it harder to treat and cure infections. STIs also represent a massive burden to the economy- in the United States alone, $16 billion is spent annually on STI-related health care costs.  But it's not all bad news! Screening programs are increasing around the world, mother to child transmission rates of diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis and HIV are decreasing, and effective treatments are continuing to be developed and delivered to patients in need. Even better, new technologies, some of which were created rapidly as part of the national COVID-19 response effort, are making it easier for people to access routine sexual health maintenance services.  We're here to answer your questions and discuss causes and cures, as well as opportunities for improvements in diagnoses and prevention strategies. We'll also discuss the emergence of new diseases and how they can be contained.  PLEASE NOTE- WE WILL NOT BE MAKING PERSONAL DIAGNOSES OR RECOMMENDING TREATMENTS.

Human: AskScience AMA Series: We're Experts Here to Discuss Sexually Transmitted Infections. AUA! Let's talk about sex(ually transmitted infections STIs])! We'll be here today at 2 PM ET for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), about the present and future of STIs.  STIs are an enormous health issue. According to the [World Health Organization, there are approximately 1 million new infections daily worldwide, resulting in 2.3 million deaths every year. In the United States, half of new STIs occur among those ages 15-24. Meanwhile, increases in antimicrobial resistance are making it harder to treat and cure infections. STIs also represent a massive burden to the economy- in the United States alone, $16 billion is spent annually on STI-related health care costs.  But it's not all bad news! Screening programs are increasing around the world, mother to child transmission rates of diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis and HIV are decreasing, and effective treatments are continuing to be developed and delivered to patients in need. Even better, new technologies, some of which were created rapidly as part of the national COVID-19 response effort, are making it easier for people to access routine sexual health maintenance services.

Human: AskScience AMA Series: We're Experts Here to Discuss Sexually Transmitted Infections. AUA! Let's talk about sex(ually transmitted infections STIs])! We'll be here today at 2 PM ET for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), about the present and future of STIs.  STIs are an enormous health issue. According to the [World Health Organization, there are approximately 1 million new infections daily worldwide, resulting in 2.3 million deaths every year. In the United States, half of new STIs occur among those ages 15-24. Meanwhile, increases in antimicrobial resistance are making it harder to treat and cure infections. STIs also represent a massive burden to the economy- in the United States alone, $16 billion is spent annually on STI-related health care costs.  But it's not all bad news! Screening programs are increasing around the world, mother to child transmission rates of diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis and HIV are decreasing, and effective treatments are continuing to be developed and delivered to patients in need. Even better, new technologies, some of which were created rapidly as part of the national COVID-19 response effort, are making it easier for people to access routine sexual health maintenance services.  We're here to answer your questions and discuss causes and cures, as well as opportunities for improvements in diagnoses and prevention strategies.

Human: AskScience AMA Series: We're Experts Here to Discuss Sexually Transmitted Infections. AUA! Let's talk about sex(ually transmitted infections STIs])! We'll be here today at 2 PM ET for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), about the present and future of STIs.  STIs are an enormous health issue. According to the [World Health Organization, there are approximately 1 million new infections daily worldwide, resulting in 2.3 million deaths every year. In the United States, half of new STIs occur among those ages 15-24. Meanwhile, increases in antimicrobial resistance are making it harder to treat and cure infections. STIs also represent a massive burden to the economy- in the United States alone, $16 billion is spent annually on STI-related health care costs.  But it's not all bad news! Screening programs are increasing around the world, mother to child transmission rates of diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis and HIV are decreasing, and effective treatments are continuing to be developed and delivered to patients in need. Even better, new technologies, some of which were created rapidly as part of the national COVID-19 response effort, are making it easier for people to access routine sexual health maintenance services.  We're here to answer your questions and discuss causes and cures, as well as opportunities for improvements in diagnoses and prevention strategies. We'll also discuss the emergence of new diseases and how they can be contained.  PLEASE NOTE- WE WILL NOT BE MAKING PERSONAL DIAGNOSES OR RECOMMENDING TREATMENTS.

Semiconductors have an “energy gap” where electrons can move from one energy level to another, sending out light in the visible range. This is used in the LED.   In Xray tubes, it is electrons deep inside the atom that jump between states, emitting much more energetic and high-frequency radiation. And electrons with very high velocity smashing into atoms, releasing energy in the same range.   In a radio transmitter, electrons are slushing back and forth between different electronic components with frequencies that are very high compared to our everyday time scales, but slowly compared to the frequencies of light or xrays.","

Things like those ashes or taking care of yourself and friends & Family.  When someone dies intestate (without a will), state law determines the heirs. You are his sole heir.   Here is some boilerplate on what has to happen:  When he died, everything he owned became the property of something called ""Estate of Dad’s Name."" Someone has to be formally appointed to be in charge of his estate. Until that appointment is made, no one has the right to dispose of or give away anything that belongs to the estate. You, by law, would have first priority to be considered for the appointment.   Technically, you don’t have the right to clean out the house until you are appointed, but since you are the sole heir, no one will care. Be sure you make a list of things that may have serious value (jewelry, antiques, a coin collection, etc.), as well as any vehicles or firearms.   Once appointed, the representative must inventory his assets and debts, use the assets to pay the debts, and distribute what is left to the legal heirs (that is, to yourself). That's ""probate.  To be appointed, you must petition the probate court in the county where he lived. Although you can do it yourself, most people find that it’s better to have a probate attorney help you. Since you don’t live in the area, the attorney can act for you in many ways and save you travel.   Many attorneys are doing video or phone consultations these days. The attorney fees will be paid out of his estate, but the attorney may want un upfront retainer.  You should immediately notify any accounts he had, such as his bank or brokerage, credit cards, cell phone carrier, doc. You can’t access the account until you are appointed, but they can freeze it to prevent identity theft.","

For example, if you were to start with a new doctor who didn’t get these notes and started to call for a problem often, they might take it as more emergent than it actually is and tell you to go to the ER instead of the office, wasting your money and time for something that is potentially already known (not to mention any mental anguish it may cause you to think that this is more serious than your usual cases).   This, of course, is just an example and probably slightly exaggerated since I don’t know your case, but not uncommon. I wouldn’t worry too much about what the wording is. I can tell you, I’ve seen more than enough patients to not care enough to judge someone who may think they’re “needy”.

In this analogy, the cookies are the computer chips or storage devices. They make thousands of them all to the same specifications, but sometimes there’s manufacturing problems (like the disbursement of the chocolate chips) and they have to test each device. After testing they may disable some parts of it and sell it off as a lower speed or lower storage capacity chip.   The reason is because it’s easier and more cost effective to make a bunch of the highest possible size and just sell the defective ones as lower ones. It means they have one production online with one machine set for making one specific item. It streamlined the whole process.   So physically nothing is different than perhaps a disabled core or cell.  On top of this, there have been leaps in how dense we can make memory so some of them use more dense memory cells that in essence are just smaller logic gates crammed into the same space.

You price the cookies on how many chocolate chips are in each cookie. With each cookie being the same size, so it takes 2 bites to eat.  Essentially the cookie itself is the outside part of the SD, the packaging, it is the same interface to the gadget. It has the right shape, connectors, etc. They are all made to set specification, so that is why your 2 GB micro-SD looks the exact same on the outside as the 64 GB micro-SD.  Now you typically say want 10 chocolate chips in each cookie, but you notice after you bake them, that some cookies have 8 or 9 chocolate chips. So you sell them as having 8 chocolate chips in them and you remove 1 chip from the cookies that have 9 chips in them.  This is known as ""binning"". So SD manufacturers will try and make all their SDs as the max size they can offer, but during the manufacturing process, it isn't perfect. So some of the SDs have storage cells that don't work, so they sell those SDs at a lower price and at a lower storage size. And they might do this multiple times. Also, if a SD doesn't fit the specification of a product, like if they sell 64 GB SDs and 32 GB SDs, but this one SD comes out with 42 GB of space, they will disable the 10 GB of space and sell it as a 32 GB SD.  Lastly, two years after you started selling cookies, you are informed that the company you buy your chocolate chips from, has found a way to sell smaller Chocolate Chips, while still retaining the same amount of sweet Chocolatey goodness of the original chocolate chip all at a lower price too. So you decide to use those new chips and instead of 10 chocolate chips per cookie, you make the cookies with 20 chocolate chips.  This part is where over time, silicon chip manufacturers have been able to get more and more transistors on the same size chip, while at a lower cost. They do this by making the transistors smaller, hence the smaller chocolate chips. So over time, they have been able to fit larger storage into the same amount of physical space as than they could years ago.","

Each square on the graph paper holds one bit (a zero or a one).  So if I want to store a lot of data, I need to have a lot of pages of graph paper, or else I need to make the squares really really small.    The smaller the squares, the more expensive the printer, because the printer must be able to deposit very thin lines of ink onto the paper, which would require a very precise print head.  The same goes for these SD cards.  When we manufacture them, we are literally drawing an electric circuit onto a board.  Part of that circuit is a grid that stores those 0's and 1's.  So we need a very precise print head to draw that circuit.    As the technology improved over the years, manufacturers are able to draw smaller grids in the same area.  Not only are they able to draw smaller grids - they have also developed the technology to read from smaller grids.    Remember that in the SD card, we are measuring whether each square has a positive or negative charge, not actually a zero or one.  When we write data to the square, we are applying a positive or negative voltage to the atoms inside the square.    When we read the data, we are checking whether each square has a positive or negative charge.  The smaller the square, the fewer the atoms, and the lower the voltage.  The lower the voltage, the more difficult it is to read.","

Human: Explain like I'm five years old: How can a micro-SD card store so much more data than another one with the exact same size? What's the physical difference? I was shopping a couple days ago looking for a replacement for my phone's 2gb micro-SD card and I noticed for the first time that there exist 64gb micro-SD cards.  Same exact size, shape (of course), brand and overall look. ¿What's the physical difference?

Human: CMV: Students should be taught how to read scientific literature in high school Hopefully this counts for fresh topic friday. I’ve seen posts talking about covering “real world” skills like taxes and stuff but nothing like this specifically.   There’s a very strong distrust of media and government in society, specifically regarding medical/scientific matters. I can’t say that distrust is unjustified either. You should always try and confirm the validity of what you read or hear. The issue is the average person doesn’t know how to discern what is and isn’t credible. I think the solution is to teach high school students how to read scientific articles.   You might think there’s too much jargon and specific knowledge for someone not in the field to understand. I disagree. When I was in college I took a course called “Communication in Biology.” It was an alternative for an English gen ed course for bio majors. It obviously focused on biology, but it taught the skills needed to get the gist of the article even in a topic you know nothing about. For example, I could understand the general concepts and credibility of a publication on climate change despite having no formal education on the matter. I may not understand every piece of it, but I can tell if a news article is accurately extrapolating the conclusions of the research article.   To implement this in high schools, this could be done in either science or English courses, or split between both. It would go over the main components of a scientific article: abstract, methods, results, conclusions, and citations. There would be a basic rundown of statistical analysis. Not necessarily how it is calculated (though That would be great to teach in math class) but rather just understanding what p values, CI, standard deviations, etc. measure and how to tell if a value is statistically significant.   Students would be taught how to answer the following questions: -What question did the researchers aim to answer? -what conclusion did they come to? -Does the data actually support that conclusion?  I can currently see two problems with this idea.   1. Finding space for it in curriculum. My solution to this would be for it to be spread out over the span of high school, not all at once. That way nothing large would have to be cut from a single course. It could also be covered partially in both science and English classes since it involves reading comprehension. Stats could be done in math class as well.   2. There is the problem of accessibility of research articles outside an academic setting. Most people won’t have institutional access to scientific journals all their lives and teachers can’t suggest something that’s technically illegal (Scihub). I don’t think it makes it unnecessary to teach, however. It teaches students to think critically about what they’re reading. That applies to all media they read, not just scholarly articles. And hopefully someday we’ll end paywalls on research articles.  This seems like a really good idea that should be implemented so I’m interested in hearing any problems with it that I haven’t considered.

I appreciate the idea, but I feel like if an insufficiently rigorous or unscrupulous researcher can't convince the average high schooler of the validity of their paper/claims, I'm having trouble thinking of what would motivate them to try to get it published in the first place.   I do think students should be exposed to those sorts of papers but I'd come at it from a different angle. I think trying to teach how to read scientific papers would either result in overconfidence in the degree to which they understand the key ideas, or they'd have a sort of vaguely memorised assortment of concepts lacking the right sort of context to internalise it properly.   I'd say encourage students to read those papers and try to familiarise themselves with the format on their own, and only really try to teach them anything if they have specific questions or make clear mistakes. Have them using conflicting papers to debate each-other and in no time they'll figure out enough on their own to criticise their opponents.","

Stats could be done in math class as well.   2. There is the problem of accessibility of research articles outside an academic setting. Most people won’t have institutional access to scientific journals all their lives and teachers can’t suggest something that’s technically illegal (Scihub). I don’t think it makes it unnecessary to teach, however. It teaches students to think critically about what they’re reading. That applies to all media they read, not just scholarly articles.

I appreciate the idea, but I feel like if an insufficiently rigorous or unscrupulous researcher can't convince the average high schooler of the validity of their paper/claims, I'm having trouble thinking of what would motivate them to try to get it published in the first place.   I do think students should be exposed to those sorts of papers but I'd come at it from a different angle. I think trying to teach how to read scientific papers would either result in overconfidence in the degree to which they understand the key ideas, or they'd have a sort of vaguely memorised assortment of concepts lacking the right sort of context to internalise it properly.   I'd say encourage students to read those papers and try to familiarise themselves with the format on their own, and only really try to teach them anything if they have specific questions or make clear mistakes. Have them using conflicting papers to debate each-other and in no time they'll figure out enough on their own to criticise their opponents.","

They might know what a paper is but it would end there. You mention media, but there are also papers out there which are just as manipulative, or indeed manipulated (see retractionwatch). Knowing what a t-test is useless if a child is looking up papers just to confirm their bias, especially if they can’t tell if something looks fishy.  Experts are the ones who can understand and interpret the data. They are the ones who can be trusted to communicate. Perhaps the blame and the solution both lie with the media.","

They might know what a paper is but it would end there. You mention media, but there are also papers out there which are just as manipulative, or indeed manipulated (see retractionwatch). Knowing what a t-test is useless if a child is looking up papers just to confirm their bias, especially if they can’t tell if something looks fishy.  Experts are the ones who can understand and interpret the data. They are the ones who can be trusted to communicate. Perhaps the blame and the solution both lie with the media.","

I appreciate the idea, but I feel like if an insufficiently rigorous or unscrupulous researcher can't convince the average high schooler of the validity of their paper/claims, I'm having trouble thinking of what would motivate them to try to get it published in the first place.   I do think students should be exposed to those sorts of papers but I'd come at it from a different angle. I think trying to teach how to read scientific papers would either result in overconfidence in the degree to which they understand the key ideas, or they'd have a sort of vaguely memorised assortment of concepts lacking the right sort of context to internalise it properly.   I'd say encourage students to read those papers and try to familiarise themselves with the format on their own, and only really try to teach them anything if they have specific questions or make clear mistakes. Have them using conflicting papers to debate each-other and in no time they'll figure out enough on their own to criticise their opponents.","

However, one of the issues I can think of with doing this is that the statistics in a lot of scientific papers is more dense than most high schoolers would be able to interpret. Without a solid grounding in statistics then it is hard to understand if what the paper is telling you is truly profound. In fact, I have noticed a lot of pop science writing falls into this trap, they will release some grabbing headline about some study which is probably really impressive, but without really understanding the baselines at play things like ""44% more,"" or whatever are kind of meaningless.   Here is one good example, if you look up Harvard's gun violence research, which is well regarded - you will run into a stat that says something like ""A gun in the home increases the risk of dying by gunshot by 4x."" OH MY GOSH! Right? Except, you don't know what the baseline is, which is miniscule when compared to the number of people and guns in the USA. 4x a small number is still a pretty small number. So what is your actual risk of death by gunshot, very low, what is it after you introduce a gun into the house - still extremely low.","

However, one of the issues I can think of with doing this is that the statistics in a lot of scientific papers is more dense than most high schoolers would be able to interpret. Without a solid grounding in statistics then it is hard to understand if what the paper is telling you is truly profound. In fact, I have noticed a lot of pop science writing falls into this trap, they will release some grabbing headline about some study which is probably really impressive, but without really understanding the baselines at play things like ""44% more,"" or whatever are kind of meaningless.   Here is one good example, if you look up Harvard's gun violence research, which is well regarded - you will run into a stat that says something like ""A gun in the home increases the risk of dying by gunshot by 4x."" OH MY GOSH! Right? Except, you don't know what the baseline is, which is miniscule when compared to the number of people and guns in the USA. 4x a small number is still a pretty small number. So what is your actual risk of death by gunshot, very low, what is it after you introduce a gun into the house - still extremely low.","

The Choice between them, on the other hand, was very real, and definitely had direct consequences. A lot of the trilogy focuses on not only the right to choose, but also the power of belief (even, *especially*, inside the Matrix itself). Thematically, it makes sense. Neo made a choice, and it was the choice that affected the outcome, because he *believed* it would affect the outcome.  I see it as sort of a placebo effect on steroids.","

There's no local HR and it's handled at corporate in a different state.   Ok so we had a work truck that the company owned that we'd use to pick up supplies like once or twice a month. It would also be used if anyone needed to make any sort of trip for the company's reasons on company time. Well this week my boss sold it. I'm going to speculate a bit and I can't prove it at all, but I'm like 80% sure he sold it to a friend or family member for cheap. It was a great truck that even I drove a couple times and it didn't have any issues with it so I don't know why he felt like selling it.   Anyway so today we needed to pick up supplies. I'm the only one here that has a truck. Boss walked into my office and told me that if I'm not busy I need to take my truck to pick up supplies or give my keys to my coworker so he can go. I point to the coat rack I have in my office that has my motorcycle jacket and helmet hanging on it and say ""I rode my bike today"" he looked annoyed and just says ""that's going to be a problem"" and walks out of my office.

I lied and told him my wife took the truck to her sister's place like 1.5 hours away. He put his hands on his hips and shook his head visibly getting more annoyed. Told me I need to bring my truck in on Monday and he'll let me know ahead of time the next time that we're running low so I can make sure that I bring my truck in.

They most likely won't fire you on the spot but believe me - every company can find something you aren't doing right even though you were doing the same things for years.  As bad as that sounds it happens alot, even in our state. It might not be for a few months but you might be on your manager's hit list since you are making his life harder. Whether that is right or wrong doesnt really matter if you care for your job.  Here is labor code 2802 (google if you want to fully understand it but it is in lawyer language) put simply: https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/hr-qa/pages/california-businessrelatedexpenses.aspx  Everything used with your vehicle should be accomodated and reimbursed for if they choose to use it.

There's no local HR and it's handled at corporate in a different state.   Ok so we had a work truck that the company owned that we'd use to pick up supplies like once or twice a month. It would also be used if anyone needed to make any sort of trip for the company's reasons on company time. Well this week my boss sold it. I'm going to speculate a bit and I can't prove it at all, but I'm like 80% sure he sold it to a friend or family member for cheap. It was a great truck that even I drove a couple times and it didn't have any issues with it so I don't know why he felt like selling it.   Anyway so today we needed to pick up supplies. I'm the only one here that has a truck. Boss walked into my office and told me that if I'm not busy I need to take my truck to pick up supplies or give my keys to my coworker so he can go. I point to the coat rack I have in my office that has my motorcycle jacket and helmet hanging on it and say ""I rode my bike today"" he looked annoyed and just says ""that's going to be a problem"" and walks out of my office. When the weather is good I like to ride my bike and the weather has been amazing here the past couple weeks.   Anyway my boss came back into my office several minutes later telling me to go with my coworker in his car to my house to get my truck so we can go get the supplies. I lied and told him my wife took the truck to her sister's place like 1.5 hours away. He put his hands on his hips and shook his head visibly getting more annoyed. Told me I need to bring my truck in on Monday and he'll let me know ahead of time the next time that we're running low so I can make sure that I bring my truck in.   So I'm really annoyed myself right now. If we needed the company truck why the hell did he sell it? Anyway I don't want my personal truck to be used as a company truck and I don't like being told what I can and can't drive into work.   So my question is can I do anything about this?? Can my boss really tell me to drive my truck to work and force me to pick up supplies in it?  I'm now intentionally not going to drive my truck into work, especially if I know we're running low.

They most likely won't fire you on the spot but believe me - every company can find something you aren't doing right even though you were doing the same things for years.  As bad as that sounds it happens alot, even in our state. It might not be for a few months but you might be on your manager's hit list since you are making his life harder. Whether that is right or wrong doesnt really matter if you care for your job.

I do not mean the systematic scheme of thought which scholars have doubtfully extracted from his writings. I allude to the wealth of general ideas scattered through them.”  Alfred North Whitehead   Start with Plato’s Dialogues and branch off from there.   Then, when you find the search for meaning waning, read the Tao Te Ching (Dao De Jing) and follow the Eastern branches of philosophy.   This is a semi-autobiographical response. That’s what helped me through my philosophical journey and I found the contrast between East and West the most fruitful.   In the West, the idea is that truth is out there somewhere and we must find it, isolate it, capture it.   In the East, the idea is that you already possess the truth and must search within.

That means they are vulnerable to the same problems as qualitative methods. But once you present quantitative figures, they assume an air of credibility. It's basically money laundering for ideas. At least qualitative analyses are upfront about their limits.  This isn't really an issue in academic settings because people are more likely to look at the methods. But in a clickbait and headline driven world, most people don't bother. A lie can get around the world before the truth has time to put on it's pants.  A truly effective quantitative model would be amazing, but human limits make them impossible. The world is outrageously complex, and trying to derive reproducible truth out of simplified models is an overwhelming challange. It's like in the show CSI where they used to say ""enhance"" and increase the resolution of low definition security camera tapes. That's impossible in real life. If you use a simple model, you can't extrapolate it to real life.   The only reason why they work in the hard sciences is because physics is a lot less complicated than the humanities. For example, the speed of light in a vacuum is the same everywhere in the universe. Meanwhile, two identical twins sitting next to each other watching the same movie at the same time might have completely different thoughts floating around in their heads.  The standard to convince scholars to take quantitative analysis in the social sciences seriously is pretty low. To alleviate skepticism, take a quantitative model and use it to make predictions that come true. Math and physics can do that. Show that you get reproducible results. All hard sciences can do that.  It doesn't need to be causation. Correlation works too, and is often used in the medical sciences. But quantitative reserach in the humanities needs to meet the same standard that quantitative reserach has to meet in any other field.  As a final point, don't mix up bias against quantitative analysis in the humanities with bias on the part of academics in the humanities.

Human: CMV: anti-quantitative biases are pervasive in the humanities and are based on a straw-man conception of quantitative methods For context, I'm in the humanities but do quantitative research in that area (applied computational linguistics). I'm trying to gauge how representative my experience of how quantitative methods are generally viewed by traditional humanities scholars is.  Basically, it seems like there is a general distaste for quantitative methods, stemming from a few sources.   First, quantitative methods are aligned with capitalism, patriarchy, and are overhyped by zelous quants who are mostly men. I can understand an association between power and quantification - it's very useful on many levels, so it's not surprising that those in power use it. But I don't see that as a barrier to using quantification for other goals and interests. In other words, an association between quantification and power is an accident of history, not something essential to quantification itself.  Second, quantitative methods have limited applicability to humanistic goals and questions. I agree it has limits. But I feel like I encounter assertions about these limits that don't make sense. Like someone saying ""I don't know how to measure fear"" ignoring the immense amount of cognitive science on measurement and conceptualization of affect. Or, statements that quantitative methods can't be intersectional because they must treat variables (like race and sexual orientation) as independent - which is just plain wrong. It's trivial to run two models with y = f(x) + f(z) and y = f(x, z) and test which model is better.   Or, legitimate limitations of a quantitative method are treated as insurmountable. Examples I've seen include peopling acting as if time series analysis doesn't exist, mixed-models don't exist, or non-linear models don't exist. Basically outright ignorance of how flexible modern statistical methods are leads to a fatalistic attitude towards the capabilities of quantitative methods.  Likewise, quantitative researchers are believed to be less thoughtful about their methods than they really are. Basically ignoring how much scientists think deeply about underlying issues in interpreting and presenting data, and never acknowledging perspectives like this: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/gelman_hennig_full_discussion.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwi8gIy-hN_gAhVFYKwKHVyRAt0QFjAAegQICBAB&usg=AOvVaw3Oe2f-yaRLIEQ-LI0s4sof   Now, I know there are plenty of dudebros who wield the word ""objectivity"" like a verbal cudgel in debates - but these guys are your average internet commenter, and don't represent the depth to which my quant colleagues understand their methods.

That's what I believe and what the general consensus was that was found in most all of my professors. For the second point there are plenty of limits and issues with quantitarive studies in the humanities that should be taken into account when looking at quantitative research but you do acknowledge this in part. Certain schools of thought are overly dismissive of the quantitative but all in all in my studies (speaking as a student not a researcher) the vast majority of my professors whilst critical of positivistic outlooks on quantitative studies and critical of the inherent flaws of the system they are just as critical of the far more qualitative schools and the issues with qualitative studies. And in my experience on faculty meetings of our social and political (communication is not mentioned but they are there too) studies as a student representative it appears most of the researchers are far from dismissive of either type of methods. Now of course this is only my experience as a student and I can't speak of other universities or fellow researchers but in my university it seems just as respected as qualitative studies only mixed method studies seem to be held in slightly higher regard. Are you certain your perception of the fields opinion on quantitative studies isn't skewed by the fact that it is easier to pick up on and overrepresent negative opinions? Just brainstorming here on a possible other explanation... Well this is the best I can give you hope it helps sorry for the lack of enters issues with my phone hope you don't mind .,"

This means that spelling varied from person to person and region to region.  Also, due to being made of bits of several languages all smushed together often retaining parts of the original language's rules, there's no consistency as to how words are pronounced or where you even get the spelling from.  A man named Samuel Johnson  eventually wrote a dictionary in which he spelled the words however he wanted to and because of how popular it became, that became the fixed spelling. Johson liked stuffy fancy spellings rather than simple phonetic ones and he set the idea of telling people the ""correct"" way to write instead of telling them how words were normally used. Webster eventually did something similar for American English, although he preferred simplified spellings, hence some of the differences between American and British spelling.","

My husband says, “so Spring cleaning is not an original American-Christian activity; it actually originated with the Jews?” Some would hard-reach to call this appropriation. I view it as inspiration. Call it Spring Cleaning or Clearing the Chametz, and the results are the same — a fresh cleaned refrigerator, freezer, oven, curtains, blinds, ceiling fans, windows that you’re opening wide to let the new Spring air in…etc. Add a spiritual component to it to make it meaningful- invite the kids to help “search for Chametz”, and discuss the ways this not only clears the home, but clears the soul. I have no problem with something like this.   However, if someone wore a kippah, just because “they like the way it looks”, I may feel uncomfortable, as that is clearly a religious symbol to revere G-d as above us. I’m not particularly worried about someone finding similar meaning, but rather it becoming a normalized fashion trend that becomes meaningless. I use kippah to identify myself and others who are Jewish, and I’d be hurt if I could no longer do that.","

Human: CMV: Cultural Appropriation a good thing in many cases. So I recently came across some interesting controversy regarding a certain celebrity speaking in a way some may refer to as a blaccent (black accent). In this particular case it’s very clear the person wasn’t mocking or demeaning in any way, and it seemingly was just the way they spoke most of the time. However I noticed that a significant number of people find this way of speaking to be offensive when the speaker isn’t black. They called it Cultural Appropriation. A term that has gained more and more traction in the last decade. Some think this act of Cultural Appropriation is a sin ranging from insensitive ignorance to straight up racism.   This is just an inevitable part of the human experience. Cultural Appropriation just a sign your culture is succeeding  If someone or some groups are respectfully trying to emulate your culture or aspects of it, wouldn’t that be a good thing? This is provided that it’s done in a respectful way (I am in no way speaking of someone mocking cultural practices). Culture and language are living things with a constant exchange between different groups. This is how cultures survive, spread, and possibly dominate.   There are many ways a culture can spread but in the case of black culture in America I think we can all agree it’s succeeding because of its cool factor. Everything from gospel and blues inspiring rock and roll to current hip hop and RnB are linked to black culture.   So my question to everyone is: Do you think cultural appropriation is bad? Why or why not and what situations make it bad. Also is it an inevitable part of human existence whether we like it or not?

This is provided that it’s done in a respectful way (I am in no way speaking of someone mocking cultural practices)  I think there is a huge middle ground between those two, that is not exactly made with an overtly ill intent, but also isn't particularly concerned with respecting the original context of the cultural artifact.  At one extreme, obviously you shouldn't take someone's music, fashion, speech style, etc. specifically to mock and demean them, that's obviously wrong beyond the scope of appropriation, it's just cruel.  At the other extreme, if for example a nation really wants their cousine to be popular worldwide, and they openly don't care who is profiting from it or what context it is produced in, then a foreigner learning it and producing more of it can be entirely respectful of their wishes.  But also, there is a lot of middle ground: for example consider a beach bar in Florida with a Papyrus font sign proclaiming it as the ""Aloha Bar"", and the place is decorated with lots of palm leaves, tapa patterns, tiki statues, and waitresses in hula skirts, and a vaguely hawaiian music playing in the background ripped from a youtube ""beats to relax to"" page, and the whole place is owned by a random white guy who thought that a native Hawaiian aesthetic feels vaguely relaxing.  That's not exactly consciously ""mocking"" native Hawaiian culture, but neither is it an example of Native Hawaiian culture ""dominating"" the world, or being treated with great respect: it is a result of Hawaii as an entire nation having ended up stolen by the US, turned into the nation's beach resort, and it's people's way of life being repurposed as branding that western businessmen use to sell products associated with pleasure and vacation time. Their housing and clothes, their music, their decorations, all of it is now something that people around the world occasionally put on as an allusion to the place where they like to go to be served Mai Tais on a beach by the people that their country conquered.  And there is something tacky, and degrading about that, even without ill intent.  A big question is whether cultural exchange is done on equal footing, so that both sides can be in charge of deciding which of their cultural artifacts do they want to promot abroad, and how much are they insisting on profiting from it, or it is done to one coulture by another one that has colonized and occupied and dominated it, where also taking their culture and making it popular without consideration ,can add insult to injury even if it wasn't done out of spite.","

If you have a background in mathematical statistics you wouldn't have too rough a time, and I think it's really important to at least get to introductory quantum mechanics to get a sense of the metaphysics, worldview, and mathematical machinery presented in by-the-book quantum stuff, as well as familiarity with some of the really important experiment designs and findings.  For self-study, I'd recommend *The Road to Reality* by Roger Penrose, a very highly regarded mathematical physicist. It's over 1,000 pages and intended for people with a background in mathematics so there's probably quite a bit of mathematics in there you'll have to learn on your own in order to be able to follow, but it really is quite a beautiful serious introduction to the main ideas in modern physics, especially theoretical physics.  Good luck, and happy learning!  Edit: Oh, and I wouldn't recommend any pop-science string-theory stuff. Some of them are quite good as far as reading for enjoyment (I liked Brian Greene's *The Elegant Universe*) but the topic is sooo complex that you'll really get virtually zero sense of *WHY* string theorists believe the stuff they believe, since the mathematics is far too complicated for the lay audience. In other words, it's not particularly helpful from a philosophical point of view. If you have absolutely no knowledge of relativity, Hawking's *A Brief History of Time* is a good really basic intro.","

You can't really understand the philosophy behind quantum mechanics and how the concepts came about without understanding the mathematical motivation and how the framework arose. Otherwise, you're just dealing with vague analogy of pop-sci quantum physics.  I recommend relativity, because I think it provides a fascinating insight into how scientific ideas can arrive from some very clear observations/assumptions, that build intuitively off of notions of Kantian philosophy and mathematics in a way that is rich in metaphysical interpretations about space and time (Einstein's interpretive papers are amazing). However, an understanding of the mathematics would require, at the very least, an education in mathematics (probably through real analysis to understand the basics of manifolds) at a level that would most likely be impractical.  I think it would also be necessary to take at least an introduction to proofs class. You don't really understand how mathematics informs science or even how ideas in mathematics and science are foundationally formulated without a basic understanding of the logic of mathematics (though you would probably only need up through basic ideas of set theory/proofs, you don't need the go into the deep end of mathematical logic).","

One is the question of what science you should know/study in order to better understand the classic texts in philosophy of science you'll be reading as an undergrad.  Another is the question of what science would be good to know/study in order to better direct your future studies (and perhaps someday, your own research, perhaps in a graduate program or beyond) in philosophy of science.  For the former question, it's probably good to brush up on classic early 20th century logic and physics, particularly Gödel's theorems and some of the classic statements of relativity and quantum mechanics. You might read Nagel and Newman's *Gödel's Proof*, and perhaps Russell's *ABCs of Relativity*, and maybe Schrödinger's *What is Life?*. (It's possible I'm slightly off on some of those titles.)  But I think for the second question, it's much more relevant to just pick some area of science that interests you, and get a good in-depth understanding of it, including the enculturation of taking several classes in it and working in a lab (if the science has labs). Starting in the 1960s or so, there was a broad move away from ""general philosophy of science"" and towards philosophy of particular sciences - initially mainly just philosophy of physics and philosophy of biology, but when I was at the Conference of the Philosophy of Science Association a few weeks ago, I went to many interesting sessions where people were talking with detailed expertise about conceptual issues in paleontology, chemistry, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, climate science, and many other areas. There's been a parallel move in philosophy of mathematics a few decades later - it's no longer just logic and set theory, but people are doing interesting work on how mathematicians actually understand the knowledge they are creating in geometry or number theory or topology or whatever, and how concepts develop, and what diagrams do, and so on.  (Also, if you're up on mathematical statistics, I'll give a shout out to Nash's *Elements of Statistical Thermodynamics* for giving me a much better understanding of what temperature is than anything else I've read.)","

Human: As a philosophy undergrad interested in philosophy of science what 'science' should I know and how should I learn about it? I am a philosophy undergrad, and am getting more and more interested in the philosophy of science (together with philosophy of mathematics and technology), but a lot of the more technical texts, which I would like to understand, rely on knowledge the sciences, especially physics. Could those more familiar with the philosophy of science help me in which scientific theories are crucial, how it might be best to learn them as a philosophy student, and maybe mediums(lectures, podcasts books) that are especially suitable for this? Maybe there have been some particular books on science for philosophy? I have a background in mathematical statistics, so recommendations relying on a strong mathematics background are also welcome.

Human: CMV: A salaried worker who only needs to work 40 hours a week should never (unless ABSOLUTELY necessary) work a single minute beyond that. I have worked with such people all over the place. They routinely put in 9-10 hour days when they are only required to work 8. From what I can tell, generally it is not anything pressing. There is no imminent deadline. They simply choose to continue working when they could easily continue the work tomorrow (which they generally always need to do anyway).  Above all else, it's a matter of getting the most out of your life. 90% of people are not happy with their jobs, so it's highly unlikely that anyone who is presently at work is enjoying their life more than they would be if they were not at work.  Simply put, there is no legal requirement for you to work beyond this. An employer cannot force you to stay at work beyond 40 hours as a salaried employee. Are there fires to fight sometimes? Sure! Please do note that I'm accounting for this, that sometimes you do need to stay late. But in my experience, the people who stay late often aren't doing it because of all the crises they are fighting; they are simply choosing to stay at work longer.  If you have a job where you ARE constantly fighting fires and having to stay late, then the smart thing to do would be to get a new job, one that actually allows you to go home at time. Those jobs exist. Don't lie to yourself and say they don't.  Why can't you walk out the door at quitting time? Why can't that task wait until tomorrow? Your company hired you to work 40 hours a week. This is why, when you're sick, you are deducted 8 hours, not 9 or 10. They can't tell you you HAVE to stay late, and if they DO, then get the hell out of that job.  Honestly, the employees I see that routinely stay late are, in fact, very INefficient workers. A great example of when I had to stay late recently was a meeting scheduled for 60 minutes, yet it went for 90, and all we did was review and discuss 5 slides of data. 5. But the people in this meeting took incredibly circuitous routes in making their points and simply could not summarize their thoughts or get beyond the ""analysis paralysis"". And because of this I got to watch one fewer episode of Modern Family which I love dearly.  The only legit reason I can think of to stay late is if you want more money or want promotions and what not. But I reject the notion that money will make you happy, and if that happiness comes at the expense of actually having the time to spend it, then what's the point? Working hard at a job you don't like to make more money is like trying to get yourself comfy on a tight airplane seat vs. lying down on a cushy sofa. There's a clear winner here.  To sum up: HAVE to stay late too much? Get a new job. Insist that your work really does take you 9-10 hours? Get more efficient.

Human: CMV: Term limits on the basis of age for United States elected federal representatives is not ageism, its practical and needed. The United States needs to set term limits on the basis of age for Congress and the President.  70+ year olds are frequently regarded as unemployable due to mental decline and disconnect with the current times, but a high number of them are serving as politicians in the United States. The oldest sitting Senator, Senator Feinstein is 88 and has served since 1992. Over twenty members of the Senate are in their 70s.

Yes, they would still occur, but they would come to an end once the official’s term expired.

Putting restrictions on who can be elected is just an exercise in the minority wishing to overrule what the majority wants, and that is fundamentally undemocratic.","

Is the age cap between citizen and politician actually indicative of anything?  When you mention the disparity between the average age of a US House member is 58 and average American is 38 years old, is this really a good measure?  Would it be more accurate to compare the average age of a Rep with the average age of the US voter, which is 45-46?  Or all Americans over the age of 18 (couldn't find that number)? Seriously asking because I don't know, but including minors seems like an inaccurate comparison.  Because including minors with citizens drags the average down, while there is never a situation where minors serves in congress.  Also, 18 year olds usually don't jump into politics right away. AOC is young, but was still 27 when first elected, almost a decade over 18.  So the age of someone serving in politics is going to naturally be higher than the population, by at least 10 years. If we were to compare the age gap of 45 (avg age of voters) for the population and 58 for the House, that's not really that far off.   What is this disparity in other countries?  Does Canada or Germany have a smaller gap?  The average age of German party members (is that politicians?) seems to be in the upper 50's too.  So my question is two fold -    1) Isn't the relevant age gap closer to 12-13 years, not 20+?  and    2) Considering that young politicians are already at least a decade older than the youngest voters, wouldn't a 10-15 age gap between politicians and voters be more of a natural gap?","

Human: CMV: Term limits on the basis of age for United States elected federal representatives is not ageism, its practical and needed. The United States needs to set term limits on the basis of age for Congress and the President.  70+ year olds are frequently regarded as unemployable due to mental decline and disconnect with the current times, but a high number of them are serving as politicians in the United States. The oldest sitting Senator, Senator Feinstein is 88 and has served since 1992. Over twenty members of the Senate are in their 70s. President Biden is 78 years old, and his health and mental prowess are the subject of continuous scrutiny. The most extreme example, Senator Thurmond, served for just short of 50 years until he passed away at 100. Currently, the average age of House members is \~58 years old and that of the Senate is \~63 years old. Contrast this with the average age of the American citizen, \~38 years old.   All too often members of Congress demonstrate their age and disconnect with the times when they must talk about social media, tech, the internet, etc. with tech giants during hearings on the Hill.   Term limits would prevent leaders from turning holding office into a career, spending upwards of 30-40 years serving in office and hanging on until they can barely function in an official capacity. Term limits would bring new and fresh perspectives into Congress. Limiting time in office would also hinder the development of permanent relationships among politicians and interest groups/lobbyists. Yes, they would still occur, but they would come to an end once the official’s term expired.  I recognize the increased turnover would lead to a larger number of politicians who are not as familiar with the legislative process as someone who has been in the office for over a decade. But wouldn’t this also provide a motivation to train their successors and offer apprenticeship/mentorship opportunities like that seen in other communities?

These things are determined using blood tests, MRIs, biopsies, exploratory surgery, etc…  Here are the stages for many of the most common cancers. Note, however, that each type of cancer is staged differently. A doctor takes the whole picture into account, so *please take these with a grain of salt.* > Stage 0 — A small tumor that has not affected any nearby tissues. Cancer at this stage can typically be fully cured by surgically removing the tumor.   > Stage 1 — The cancer hasn’t spread to other body parts, but nearby tissues are impacted. (For example, there might be cancerous cells in the tissue immediately surrounding the tumor or primary cancer site.)  > Stage 2 — As soon as the cancer spreads to another body part, it becomes Stage 2. In this stage, the spread is still local, usually limited to the organs right next the the primary tumor. Occasionally, cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes is staged here.   > Stage 3 — Like Stage 2, this is usually limited to fairly localized cancer spread. In this stage, however, the regional spread is more advanced. This stage also includes significant spread to the lymph nodes. (Lymph nodes matter because cancer cells could *potentially* travel through your lymphatic system to other body parts).   > Stage 4 — Sometimes called metastatic cancer, this stage is usually reserved for advanced cancer that has traveled to distant body parts.   ——  **LIFE EXPECTANCY**  This is pretty straight forward: life expectancy is just a game of statistics. The doctor determines your type of cancer, stages it, then looks at data for other people who had the same diagnosis. They basically take the average of the lengths of time these other people lived and bam, there’s the life expectancy.   Sometimes it’s a little more complicated than that, but the most important takeaway is that **life expectancy is *not* a prediction…it’s a guess.** Some people die sooner, some die shortly after, and other people outlive their life expectancy by several years. [In fact, here’s an important rule of thumb to remember when you read any stats about anything: *statistics tell you nothing about the individual.*]","

Stage 4 cancer means it has already spread to other organs.  As for the survival rate, that's where it gets a little complicated. It's not just a percent chance of survival, but it's a percent chance of survival for X years. For example, you might have a 75% chance to survive for 5 years. This is going to be based off of data comparing other people who have had a similar cancer and their outcomes.  Now what does the survival rate actually mean? Well, even when an early stage cancer is treated, there is a possibility that cancer cells were missed, or had already spread in your body. Even when treated, there is a decently high chance that the cancer was never fully defeated, and it will take a certain amount of time to grow back from individual cells into something that actually kills you. That's why an individuals cancer is never really ""cured"".","

As for stuff you can do *without* risking your precious squishy butt in combat, you can fill the roles of Police helicopters, carry a tranq gun, or a bunch of smoke/stun grenades. You're obviously going to be invaluable in any rescue op where movement is restricted, or when it's hard for helicopters to intervene (trees in the way, crazy winds, etc).  Flight doesn't get exploited very often because it's an extremely common *secondary* power, but make no mistake it is a fantastic power.","

But that doesn't mean it's shortsighted: quite the opposite.   The issue with Trump is not that he's a Republican or a conservative. The issue is not that he's costing Democrats votes, or pushing aside the Democratic political agenda. The issue is that *he is a goddamn child occupying the most powerful position on earth*. Yes, Pence has more mainstream appeal, and will probably be even more effective at pushing the Republican party line. He's also an adult with experience in government and is much less inclined to shoot from the hip on matters of life and death. If he were president instead of Trump, that would be terrible for the Democrats in the next election. It would also be a much better state of affairs for America and the world.   Impeachment would only be shortsighted for Democrats if those Democrats valued their party over their country.","

Trump is currently distracting from a *very* unpopular health care bill. You mention a few ""populist wins"" as though that will be a cakewalk. The GOP has achieved exactly zero populist wins in the most forgiving period of a presidency - how exactly will this become easier when *also* dealing with the political fallout from an impeachment, without any distractions for cover?

There are a lot of unknowns here that would complicate your narrative.     1. Why is Trump being impeached in your hypothetical? Has the Russia investigation turned up nothing, or has there been serious criminal activity? The severity of the charges dramatically changes the political calculus here. You casually mention that Clinton's impeachment boosted his numbers - but you forget that Nixon's resignation did very serious harm to the Republican party. If Trump's hypothetical impeachment is a result of Nixonian levels of corruption, the fallout will spread much further than Trump himself, like rendering the most hardcore Trump allies (Pence included) politically toxic.     2. Who impeached Trump? If it was a significant part of the GOP, expect Republican infighting to worsen and no significant ""populist wins"" on the legislative front. If Democrats control Congress in this scenario, Pence will have no legislative success and likely still be facing investigations and hearings throughout the entirety of his remainder in office to determine any culpability. Even if he's squeaky clean, Democrats will make Trumps impeachment front and center a là Benghazi for a while - and tying Pence to Trump as much as possible.     3. An interesting side effect of Trump's controversial administration is that it is actually making it easier for Republicans to work on unpopular legislation. Trump is currently distracting from a *very* unpopular health care bill. You mention a few ""populist wins"" as though that will be a cakewalk. The GOP has achieved exactly zero populist wins in the most forgiving period of a presidency - how exactly will this become easier when *also* dealing with the political fallout from an impeachment, without any distractions for cover? The GOP is frankly not high functioning at the moment, and an impeachment wouldn't help.        4. Pence wasn't all too popular in Indiana before he was tapped for VP. I don't think he has the chops for a presidential bid even without the hypothetical involvement in an impeached administration.     Long story short, no way in hell is President Pence going to have the political capital or public popularity to pull any of that off.","

(It's a guarantee that Republicans will retain the Senate) This means that if Trump got impeached and removed it would be for something Republicans can't defend, so I doubt his approval rating would rise.   A President Pence is much better than Trump. For starters, he is just your average Republican. What about him is worse than Trump? I mean Pence wouldn't pull shit like trying to ban an entire religion from the country.  Pence would be a president with positions I disagree with. That's much less destructive than an incompetent hateful buffoon who sows distrust and divisiveness  and in your scenario, has committed impeachment worthy acts.","

But that was because high school analysis doesn't actually go into anything of substance.  It was as basic as possible because it had to be accessible to people who didn't really read.  You can't truly understand the book if you don't understand the literary devices used.  As someone who enjoys reading, I am guessing you find it boring because you've already begun analyzing books on your own.  You just haven't realized you were doing it.  I enjoy a book much more thoroughly when I analyze the prose and motifs.  It's no fun studying things you intuitively understand--the same thing happens in every subject.  Take a few literature classes when you get to college(above the freshman level english at the very least.)  I can almost promise you that you will find greater enjoyment in literature than you did before learning how to **really** delve into a book.","

Keep in mind, like any product, it can be screwed by customers prior to use.

I would record every little issue and compile it in a spreadsheet. We've had many hours of arguments with manufacturers.  This isn't what you asked for, but maybe it will help to understand what is happening on the customer end. Most of the time it really is a manufacturing or shipping issue (obviously biased). After many heated debates we decided to inspect the equipment before offloading it from the trucks. Took pictures and sent them to the manufacturers until they conceded. Maybe you can suggest a similar process for a few shipments.  Remember that there's also internal politics on the customer side. As a customer, I hated some products we were buying. The products were vastly inferior to the competitors but slightly cheaper. To justify the cost difference for changing manufacturers, I recorded every little problem to show to my management. Those situations are going to be hard for you to handle but it's often in your company's best interest to play along and offer small adjustments to the manufacturing process or QA process.","

Over the last 7 months, I have had a roll of customer prioritization; I fix one issue and headache only to move on to the next. Normal, but it's been ""This is now top priority"" from one to the next.  My most recent headache was just this morning, a customer being upset with a report regarding a product they tried to warranty. Long story short, it's not warranty. However, they emailed back within 24 hrs saying, paraphrasing here, that ""I (my company) continuously blame the end-user and one of the products was not even placed in service."" Keep in mind, like any product, it can be screwed by customers prior to use. Also, this is literally the first return of 2 units within a 6 month period and they also claim they've had so many issues within the last 6 months.   Sometimes, I am literally gasping for air over the ""shocked"" people and insane customer claims over 1-5 products they fucked over and want my company to eat the cost.  Curious to know how you all respond to customers like this.

If that truth is inconvenient or not being accepted, then it's time to involve management and have QC stop communicating directly with the client.   Instead, QC sends their stuff to whoever holds the actual relationship with the client. They can earn their 5% by deciding how to communicate the issues and troubleshoot the problem.  If it can be resolved with Engineering, then it can he resolved in the contract. Maybe we accept a 5% higher error rate, no problem, let's just adjust the contract rates in-kind.

We have a really great management team here, but sometimes we get some bananas request or ideas come up. I usually start by asking what problem they are trying to solve, what they think the solution is, and what does success look like (reduction in downtime, $ saved, safety risk mitigation) and I always ask for the data that supports this. There is healthy discussion, but the best idea always needs to win.   Now, sometimes we have to do things for the sake of trying. Most times we come to solid conclusions. For the ideas that will likely fail, I communicate this to the top with my concerns, backed by data, experience, etc. If I am told to do it anyways, drop that gem in my CYA folder and get to work.","

""This product literally never works and has always been terrible since you shipped 10 to us a year ago"". Interesting that we are just now hearing about it.   In my personal experience, it's important to know how the product is being sold. Some companies have a sales culture where they will tell the customer literally ANYTHING. They'll tell them the warranty is just a formality and everything is repaired for free. They'll tell them that the product does things it isn't supposed to do. They'll keep trunk stock of product that is used and install it for customers without their knowledge. They'll fail to report actually recurring issues then try to act like it's your fault. The worst part is that it works most of the time.   I know you don't want meetings, but it's important to level with the sales organization about the problems you are seeing, and in many cases, the sales person needs to be the one to smooth this over with the customer. If that involves giving the customer products or services for free, that comes from the sales budget. Stick with your facts and make the special allowances their call and their expense. They may not be aware, or the specific sales person may not be aware how their actions are affecting the business.","

If it was ongoing, they could spend vast amounts on infrastructure; more design and test facilities, more money for aerospace engineering education, start working on strategic plans for the ongoing yearly budget. They wouldn't have to pick and choose which missions to do, they could do basically all of their missions within reason. Europa and Enceladus? Sure, why not?  We could have observation satellites around every planet within a decade (depending on transit time to Neptune). With that kind of money, more companies besides SpaceX would enter the privatized space flight business as NASA would have plenty of resupply missions to contract out. The Mars program could be accelerated greatly. The Moon would probably get more than a 'plant the flag and take samples' mission, one of more permanence.

As one might expect, for such a politically charged and relevant question it becomes *really* difficult to separate history proper from politics.   One reasonable way to approach the question is to look at what the leaders of the revolution thought and how they preceived or justified authoritarianism. It's also important to understand their political experience and context.   A good starting point I think is the late 19th century, when the Second International, an association of primarily Marxist parties across Europe, suffered an internal crisis between *reformists* and *revolutionists*. At that point, the revolutionary character of Marxism was not yet agreed upon among its followers, and within the parties reformist Marxists tended to hold sway. Unlike modern social democrats, these reformists still (if only nominally) held the ultimate goal of overcoming capitalism; the major disagreement was if this could be achieved by working entirely within the bourgeois state. This question of reform or revolution is discussed with some more historical context in the revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg's eponymous pamphlet, written at the height of this conflict. Eduard Bernstein's works give the reformist perspective.  (As an aside, Rosa Luxemburg was a revolutionist in Germany and Poland who collaborated extensively with Lenin. She would later disagree tactically with Lenin during the Russian revolution but, as I believe, they had no fundamental doctrinal differences-- one can expect that Luxemburg's comments about reform and revolution are broadly the same as Lenin's)  As Europe approached the First World War, the reformist tendency within socialist parties would deepen and even take on a nationalistic character. By then, the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) had become the dominant socialist party within Europe, having achieved significant labor reforms and boasting a membership in the millions. This, combined with the threat of invasion from a deeply reactionary Russia, compelled German reformists to associate socialism with German patriotism, and national defense with the defense of socialism (ironically, a similar trend would occur in France *against* Germany, which many Frenchmen perceived as a reactionary threat against their republic). Revolutionists, on the other hand, tended to have an internationalist outlook, believing that only an international revolution against imperialist warfare could defend socialism.  When WW1 broke out at last, the SPD (and most other European parties) voted in favor of war, beginning a period of *Burgfriedenspolitik* wherein the SPD abstained from strikes and other subversive activities against the war effort. The revolutionists and few reformists who disagreed with this policy splintered away from the SPD into the Independent SPD, the Spartacist League, and eventually the German Communist Party. Notably, Lenin's party in Russia also opposed war by majority, foreshadowing the dominance of revolutionists in the upcoming struggle.  This is all to say that the events leading up to WW1 and the Russian revolution precipitated huge, seemingly irreconciliable divisions between the reformist and revolutionist factions of the European socialists. This conflict would take on its most bloody form in the 1918-19 Spartacus uprising at the end of the German revolution: once in power, the now wholly reformist SPD would brutally crush their revolutionist counterparts as they attempted to establish worker's states. Remember again that these were former comrades who, decades ago, would have relied on each other's cooperation.  So what does this have to do with authoritarianism in Russia? The leaders of the Russian revolution were internationalists, and had counted on the victory of the German revolutionaries and, hence, the victory of a sweeping revolution across the world. The hope was that, since Germany was among the foremost industrial powers of the world, it could provide material necessities and alleviate the stresses of war, in turn allowing for demilitarization and democratization across both Germany and Russia. This didn't happen-- again, the German revolutionaries were massacred by reformists. It's possible that the Bolsheviks miscalculated, or simply that the Bolsheviks had no other choice but to push forward and *hope* that Germany would turn around. Probably both. In any case, the ascendant Bolsheviks were left in a very, *very* difficult situation: they were in charge of a war-weary nation with hostile states (particularly now Germany) on all sides and powerful counterrevolutionaries within. Realistically there was only one thing they could do besides capitulate-- dig in, and use the full power of the state to survive for as long as possible.  Rosa Luxemburg summarizes this impasse pretty well in The Russian Tragedy (which is short but extremely useful in understanding the attitudes of communists at the time -- a must read!):  > The awkward position that the Bolsheviks are in today, however, is, together with most of their mistakes, a consequence of basic insolubility of the problem posed to them by the international, above all the *German*, proletariat. To carry out the dictatorship of the proletariat and a socialist revolution in a single country surrounded by reactionary imperialist rule and in the fury of the bloodiest world war in human history – that is squaring the circle. Any socialist party would have to fail in this task and perish – whether or not it made self-renunciation the guiding star of its policies. ... **Such is the false logic of the objective situation: any socialist party that came to power in Russia today must pursue the wrong tactics so long as it, as part of the international proletarian army, is left in the lurch by the main body of this army.**  As an example of ""wrong tactics,"" Trotsky discusses in a report that the early Soviet worker's militia could not confront the vastly better-equipped and better-trained German army, nor even the relatively more experienced armies under White control. As a result, Trotsky was compelled to professionalize the army, institute harsh drafts, and even incorporate captured White officers at gunpoint just to win the civil war. Both he and Lenin recognized that these measures were counter to the principles of the revolution but were nonetheless necessary if the revolution were to survive at all.  As we now know, neither Germany nor any comparably industrialized country underwent a successful communist revolution. The Soviets would remain isolated long after Lenin's death, and Stalin would further entrench authoritarianism-- what started as emergency measures became standard procedure when the emergency never went away. (EDIT: This part feels a bit insufficient. I don't want to attribute the entrenchment of authoritarianism as something unique to Stalin as a person -- it was likely a combination of broad social forces and personality. I might point to the rising nationalism in Marxist reformists are an analogous process, but this would require a more detailed treatment of Stalin I am not really prepared to make.)  For subsequent revolutions, the ""fruit from a poisoned tree"" situation you described is sort of right-- these revolutions drew explicitly from Lenin's revolutionary measures and, sometimes less explicitly, from Stalin's entrenchment. One might even say that they were all part of a single, broader revolution, and can't be treated as isolated cases. Later on certain countries like Cambodia and North Korea would spin off on their own and abandon communism even in name, but since they faced the same problems of political isolation, they had at least an excuse to remain authoritarian.   It's probably not true that failure was inevitable, which would ignore the later history of Trotskyism and other oppositional forces in, most notably, the USSR and the China. But I don't want to spin off into counterfactuals-- things *could* have happened differently, but they didn't, and that's the question you're asking.  In summary:  * Pre-WW1 politics caused a deep rift between reformist and revolutionary factions in European socialism  * This led to the (short-term) success of the Russian revolution and the failure of the German revolution, as reformists were much more powerful in the latter country  * Without German support, the Russian Bolsheviks had to enact emergency authoritarian measures to remain afloat  * Later, the static international situation allowed authoritarianism to be entrenched  * Future revolutions would emulate the Bolsheviks and in turn face the same problems of political isolation  Note again that this is just a single perspective, taking into account mostly primary sources from the leaders of the Russian and German revolutions. Still, this is an important point of view I think, and the one I'm most familiar with.  Further reading:  * Luxemburg's The Russian Tragedy, which discusses the Bolsheviks' policies in relation to the German socialists  * Luxemburg's The Crisis of German Social Democracy which goes in depth about the division and irreconciliability of factions within the SPD  * The Military Writings of Trotsky, for a deeper look into the Russian Civil War  * Lenin's The State and Revolution, key to understanding the place of democracy in Lenin's ideology","

Human: Why do Communist societies that we've seen tend toward authoritarianism and dictatorial-style arrangements? First off, I'm sorry for my lack of knowledge on this topic, and want to note that I almost asked this in /r/NoStupidQuestions but decided an educated answer would be better than a flamewar. And before anyone says it, sure, maybe prehistoric tribes can be labelled ""communist"" and maybe didn't operate this way, but I am referring to the myriad 20th century communist countries that made up the ""second World"".   It's hard to get a clear answer without devolving into ""communism bad"" ""no, communism good"". From what I can tell, it's not necessarily required for a communist state to have a single authoritarian leader, yet all real-world examples I can think of had very consolidated power arrangements into a single position? There are free-market dictatorships and free-market republics, but it seems that any Communist state went down an authoritarian route of some kind-- Stalin, Tito, Mao, Castro?

Human: Why do Communist societies that we've seen tend toward authoritarianism and dictatorial-style arrangements? First off, I'm sorry for my lack of knowledge on this topic, and want to note that I almost asked this in /r/NoStupidQuestions but decided an educated answer would be better than a flamewar. And before anyone says it, sure, maybe prehistoric tribes can be labelled ""communist"" and maybe didn't operate this way, but I am referring to the myriad 20th century communist countries that made up the ""second World"".   It's hard to get a clear answer without devolving into ""communism bad"" ""no, communism good"".

Math can tell you that 300,000 is a big number, but it can't tell you whether this is a reasonable price to pay for a house, or what acceptable mortgage terms on that house will be. The numbers alone are essentially meaningless without context, and it's the adults and institutions around teens that provide that context for them. And the context surrounding student loans was always ""yes it seems like a lot of debt, but trust us (the people who are selling you that debt and/or don't know any better themselves) it won't matter because you'll be making a lot of money with your degree"". And teens not only lack social literacy (due to young age) but they have just got done with grade school, where we teach them that capitalism is moral and that all they have to do is work hard and they will succeed, not exactly the social context to realize they are being scammed. And obviously, when people say things like ""18 year olds should not be expected to make life-long financial decisions"", *this* is what they are talking about, not a supposed metal condition that makes teens unable to do basic multiplication, or something","

Also auto transmissions have come a long, long way in the past 20-30 years, most modern ones you can kind of live with but the older ones are just rubbish.  For some people (including myself), an automatic transmission is simply a dealbreaker for a driver's car and when they have their mind set on a certain type and they can't find it as a MT, then the effort may be worth it for them.","

Human: Why do people go through the trouble of converting Automatic to Manual? And Vice Versa? Couldn’t you buy the car in the original format, unless there was something in the car you desired, I completely understand but isn’t it much more expensive to convert the said transmission than to buy the original transmission, and also expensive because it was automatic (meaning automatics are priced higher than a manual due to the easy usage). Please note I’m not hating on anyone for changing their car the way they want, I’m just not understanding why you would want to convert a transmission that’s all.

Sometimes this occurs because the vehicle was not offered in the current configuration with a manual transmission, other times it may be a better/easier solution than finding the vehicle with a manual transmission.   For instance, I love C5 Audi Allroads. The engine choices were a 4.2l v8 or a 2.7TT v6. The v8 only came in automatic. The v6 was offered with a manual transmission, but they were relatively uncommon. Therefore, you will see people with the v8 swap the auto trans for manual because there was no option. You will also see the v6 with auto transmissions be swapped to manual ones, just because it is so hard to find a low mile, quality one from the factory. It is cheaper and easier to just swap the trans that wait for the right manual transmission car to become available. Does that make sense?","

I also love Great British Bake-off for many reasons but one of them is the flavor pairings that the contestants come up with. Granted sometimes the pairings don’t work, but sometimes they do and it’s fun to see all the combos—from traditional pairings and “traditional with a twist”, to the crazy ones.  From there once you know the “classic” pairings, it’s fun to start branching out by changing out one of them with something similar. For example, taking the example above, we know lemon and meringue go well together so why not swap out the lemon with something similar like grapefruit or lime meringue? Or we know rum and orange juice is a classic, so why not try doing a rum flavored cream in your blood orange or tangerine tart? Etc.","

It provides tenderizing, texture, browing and the ability to retain moisture, among others.   Eliminating refined sugars from a low cal diet is important but you may be able to add some natural sugars and the fiber that comes along with them, which will provide sweetness plus added nutritional benefits.   I would consider using bananas, apples, applesauce pears, or even prunes. They can be blended, mashed or cut up into pieces and added to a recipe. Prunes, although naturally high in sugar  wont spike insulin and are packed with antioxidants.   While  replacement sweeteners are expensive some are more sweet than sugar so you end up using less. That combined with natural sugars may make it more affordable.","

Human: Former grad student, considering suing my university for $14k unpaid wages (Texas) Long story short, I completed my graduate degree back in December and my graduate advisor still owes me $14,000 in unpaid wages for the work I did in their research lab during my last year of grad school. This professor paid me what they promised for the first few years, but then they stopped abruptly. The excuses for why I wasn't getting paid kept building up and changing over time, and as soon as I was on my way out the professor started stonewalling me, on multiple occasions literally just walking out of the room when I tried to talk to them. During the year where I wasn't getting paid, this professor also intentionally sabotaged my efforts to find work elsewhere. They lied about me in emails and over the phone with other professionals in our relatively small field of work. Multiple people in and out of the university contacted me and told me ""Hey, I thought you should know this is what Dr. Professor said about you, and I know that's not true"".  I contacted the dean of my college, and they referred the matter to university legal affairs. I gave Legal copies of emails and written notes from face-to-face conversations where I was promised a salary, they asked me to come in and talk to them, I did, and then they did nothing. I informed them that this professor has done this to at least three other students over the course of at least five years. One of the other students had to drop out because, unlike me, they didn't have any external funding. I gave them piles of documentation, much of it taken from the university's own records, showing how the professor had falsified financial statements, employment records, grant proposals and reports, how the professor was paying students less than promised or nothing at all and using personnel money to buy equipment because they intentionally underestimated their equipment costs to make their grant proposal seem more competitive. University legal still did nothing. I contacted them again to ask if they needed any additional information from me, if they had planned or taken any corrective action, if they were planning on paying me my wages, no response of any kind.  Granted, they have been busy the past few weeks with coaches taking bribes from celebrities, but I spoke to them months before that. As far as I know, at this point my only option is to just sue the university directly. They have a massive legal department and they've argued in front of SCOTUS multiple times in the past few years, so I have no idea if or how I should approach this, but the simple fact of the matter is that this professor owes me $14,000 in unpaid wages, I have written statements promising me that amount, they slandered me in professional settings, and they're lying to the university and the federal government about how they're using research funds.

You need to start thinking of them as an adverse party, and you probably should not have any further contact with them without advice from your own attorney.  To that end, you should probably consult with an attorney. It sounds (in my completely unprofessional opinion) like you have a case that an attorney might be willing to accept for a contingency fee. This means that you wouldn't pay your attorney up front, but if you win a judgment or reach a settlement, your attorney would receive a portion of that amount as his/her fee. It may be possible for you to pursue an administrative resolution (probably Texas Workforce Commission) without an attorney, but I would go ahead and consult with an attorney sooner rather than later.","

Human: Former grad student, considering suing my university for $14k unpaid wages (Texas) Long story short, I completed my graduate degree back in December and my graduate advisor still owes me $14,000 in unpaid wages for the work I did in their research lab during my last year of grad school. This professor paid me what they promised for the first few years, but then they stopped abruptly. The excuses for why I wasn't getting paid kept building up and changing over time, and as soon as I was on my way out the professor started stonewalling me, on multiple occasions literally just walking out of the room when I tried to talk to them. During the year where I wasn't getting paid, this professor also intentionally sabotaged my efforts to find work elsewhere. They lied about me in emails and over the phone with other professionals in our relatively small field of work. Multiple people in and out of the university contacted me and told me ""Hey, I thought you should know this is what Dr. Professor said about you, and I know that's not true"".  I contacted the dean of my college, and they referred the matter to university legal affairs. I gave Legal copies of emails and written notes from face-to-face conversations where I was promised a salary, they asked me to come in and talk to them, I did, and then they did nothing. I informed them that this professor has done this to at least three other students over the course of at least five years. One of the other students had to drop out because, unlike me, they didn't have any external funding. I gave them piles of documentation, much of it taken from the university's own records, showing how the professor had falsified financial statements, employment records, grant proposals and reports, how the professor was paying students less than promised or nothing at all and using personnel money to buy equipment because they intentionally underestimated their equipment costs to make their grant proposal seem more competitive. University legal still did nothing. I contacted them again to ask if they needed any additional information from me, if they had planned or taken any corrective action, if they were planning on paying me my wages, no response of any kind.  Granted, they have been busy the past few weeks with coaches taking bribes from celebrities, but I spoke to them months before that. As far as I know, at this point my only option is to just sue the university directly. They have a massive legal department and they've argued in front of SCOTUS multiple times in the past few years, so I have no idea if or how I should approach this, but the simple fact of the matter is that this professor owes me $14,000 in unpaid wages, I have written statements promising me that amount, they slandered me in professional settings, and they're lying to the university and the federal government about how they're using research funds.

Also contact the US Attorney's office that covers texas/the part of texas you are in.  &#x200B;  This is a large scale federal crime, and since the amounts are so high your professor is into the range of federal felony charges that carry stiff minimums.  He is defrauding the federal government, and you should blow the whistle on his ass.  This kind of stuff is taken very seriously, the OIG's of each department are independent ish watchdogs that regularly blow the whistle on internal incompetence and malfeasance.  They'll have no issue or trouble going full metal on a professor who doesn't seem to have any talent for committing financial crime.  &#x200B;  Edit:  Also talk to a labor lawyer in your university town/area, chances are they'll have a better understanding of the complexities of graduate student employment law/contracts.","

Human: Former grad student, considering suing my university for $14k unpaid wages (Texas) Long story short, I completed my graduate degree back in December and my graduate advisor still owes me $14,000 in unpaid wages for the work I did in their research lab during my last year of grad school. This professor paid me what they promised for the first few years, but then they stopped abruptly. The excuses for why I wasn't getting paid kept building up and changing over time, and as soon as I was on my way out the professor started stonewalling me, on multiple occasions literally just walking out of the room when I tried to talk to them. During the year where I wasn't getting paid, this professor also intentionally sabotaged my efforts to find work elsewhere. They lied about me in emails and over the phone with other professionals in our relatively small field of work. Multiple people in and out of the university contacted me and told me ""Hey, I thought you should know this is what Dr. Professor said about you, and I know that's not true"".  I contacted the dean of my college, and they referred the matter to university legal affairs. I gave Legal copies of emails and written notes from face-to-face conversations where I was promised a salary, they asked me to come in and talk to them, I did, and then they did nothing.

As a graduate Research Assistant, you're not employed by your professor, you're employed by the university. Your professor isn't responsible for paying you directly, doesn't handle grant money directly, and doesn't have any say in how much you get paid—that's set by the university and/or the department. The university, through the department, hires you as an RA at a certain wage for a certain length of time, and is responsible for paying you. What your professor *is* responsible for is reporting the time you've worked on their projects (or approving your timesheets if you filled them out yourself). Those reports go to the university grants office, the grants office then bills the funding agency for your wages and associated overhead, and the agency then reimburses the university.  So the question is, did you actually have formal employment through the university as a Research Assistant? You said  >This professor paid me what they promised for the first few years  How were you being paid—were you getting checks from the university, or in some other way? If you were actually employed by the university, maybe you had an RA for a while but then your professor didn't renew it. If your professor was somehow paying you directly, that's more sinister—it's possible they were somehow embezzling money from the grant and then paying you under the table to avoid being charged for overhead. Either way, your first step is to contact the department and find out what your employment status was.","

Universities are really good about following the law on this kind of thing and professors really can't break the law here even if we tried.  If you signed paperwork with the professor agreeing to a particular wage, then your university's admin staff should be taking care of all the details, and there's nothing that the professor could do to deny you the money.  The admin staff wouldn't let the paperwork get created if the money wasn't already reserved for you.  If you didn't sign paperwork, well... then you didn't have an employment agreement with the professor.  I suspect that you have misunderstood the obligations the professor has from his NSF grants and other sources of income.  The prof possibly intentionally misrepresented this to you and exploited you, but that doesn't change the fact that you weren't in an employer/employee relationship.  Possibly there's a fraud angle that you could play, but I doubt there's a wage theft angle.","

Human: Former grad student, considering suing my university for $14k unpaid wages (Texas) Long story short, I completed my graduate degree back in December and my graduate advisor still owes me $14,000 in unpaid wages for the work I did in their research lab during my last year of grad school. This professor paid me what they promised for the first few years, but then they stopped abruptly. The excuses for why I wasn't getting paid kept building up and changing over time, and as soon as I was on my way out the professor started stonewalling me, on multiple occasions literally just walking out of the room when I tried to talk to them. During the year where I wasn't getting paid, this professor also intentionally sabotaged my efforts to find work elsewhere. They lied about me in emails and over the phone with other professionals in our relatively small field of work. Multiple people in and out of the university contacted me and told me ""Hey, I thought you should know this is what Dr. Professor said about you, and I know that's not true"".  I contacted the dean of my college, and they referred the matter to university legal affairs. I gave Legal copies of emails and written notes from face-to-face conversations where I was promised a salary, they asked me to come in and talk to them, I did, and then they did nothing. I informed them that this professor has done this to at least three other students over the course of at least five years. One of the other students had to drop out because, unlike me, they didn't have any external funding. I gave them piles of documentation, much of it taken from the university's own records, showing how the professor had falsified financial statements, employment records, grant proposals and reports, how the professor was paying students less than promised or nothing at all and using personnel money to buy equipment because they intentionally underestimated their equipment costs to make their grant proposal seem more competitive. University legal still did nothing. I contacted them again to ask if they needed any additional information from me, if they had planned or taken any corrective action, if they were planning on paying me my wages, no response of any kind.  Granted, they have been busy the past few weeks with coaches taking bribes from celebrities, but I spoke to them months before that.

Universities are really good about following the law on this kind of thing and professors really can't break the law here even if we tried.  If you signed paperwork with the professor agreeing to a particular wage, then your university's admin staff should be taking care of all the details, and there's nothing that the professor could do to deny you the money.  The admin staff wouldn't let the paperwork get created if the money wasn't already reserved for you.  If you didn't sign paperwork, well... then you didn't have an employment agreement with the professor.  I suspect that you have misunderstood the obligations the professor has from his NSF grants and other sources of income.

The Nazis, for example, were environmentalists. Instead of increasing regulation of industry, as most liberals/leftists would advocate, they laid the blame on Jews, Poles, and other minorities. It's debatable whether they truly even believed in environmentalism, or if they were just using it as a thinly-veiled excuse for their bigotry.   Another thing is there is no guarantee that both sides will work together long enough for actual progress to be made. Trump's rhetoric in his 2016 campaign was grounded in populist rhetoric - he even called for raising taxes on the rich. When it came down to the actual policy, however, it ended up being just that - rhetoric.","

Human: CMV: America needs a populist political movement that focuses on widely agreed upon political and economic reforms instead of wedge issues and culture wars According to polling data there are a great many political and economic reforms that are widely supported by the general populace  and would be beneficial to the majority of Americans. Statistically most Americans support things like higher minimum wages, ending citizens united, a more socialized healthcare system, electoral reform, and an end to outsourcing and free trade agreements. However instead of focusing on these areas of common ground most politics and political movements focus on issues that are both widely divisive and much smaller in scope such as abortion, gun control, which bathrooms people should be allowed to use, and how different groups are represented in the media.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  The result of this is that people continue to be politically divided in spite of the large degree of common ground many of us have politically. By contrast an agenda of political and economic populism could both unite people and lead to real progress for many. Not only are political and economic reforms fairly universally supported, but they can also be argued for through appeals to rational self interest unlike a lot of wedge issues and culture war stuff which are heavily subjective and difficult to sway people on.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Obviously achieving this wouldn't be easy but I think it would still be the best way to achieve tangible progress on political and economic reform in this country instead of the perpetual gridlock we always seem to be in now.

There is no widely agreed upon political and economic reform. People are losing their minds over having to wear a facemask. The centrism approach of ""both sides"" is a fever dream at best. At worst it ignores the plights of the average American as something solvable by just getting along.   Defunding the police is a great example. Entertaining the idea is considered fringe with zero budge for listening to alternative solutions. That's not something that a populist agenda would solve. Rather it'd be perpetuated behind discussion, bureaucracy, etc. Meanwhile law enforcement would still have relatively unchecked lethal power.  We all want to believe that there's a central majority that just wants the best. That's just not the case. What people want is to feel good about supporting social safety nets while not actually wanting their lives interrupted. They want to say black lives matter but aren't willing to change the status quo to achieve it. It's not out of evil, it's out of apathy. Maybe they cared once but have become complacent and apathetic towards the harsh realities faced by others.  Appealing to the masses would, in my opinion, just cause stagnation through deliberation. If a person is going to support those necessary changes it's going to come at the cost of approval on other things or by specific demographics. Prioritizing the importance of the change is more crucial than waiting for everyone to get on board with the idea.","

Both are forms of universal public healthcare. South Korea and Canada use a single payer system, where the goverent acts as a single  insurance provider. The UK's NHS is an example of a truly socialized healthcare system, where doctors are salaried employees of the state, and hospitals, etc are government owned. Likely the latter is more cost effective in the long run, but the transition would be ***VERY*** rough. With a single payer system, the government steps in as the insurer. Much easier; its how the transition worked in Canada.   >an end to outsourcing and free trade agreements.

Populism is, distinctly, an appeal to ""the people"" that is, under the hood, implicitly or explicitly slicing up the population into who qualifies as the ""true people"" and the not. Populism always passes judgment onto ""the elites"" while claiming to represent ""the people,"" but what classifies as the elite and the people necessarily depends on the populist in charge. Often, the populist is correct in identifying a group of ""elites"" that has considerable power over ""the people,"" e.g. Bernie Sanders' declaration of Wall St. banker types spitting down on the likes of all else, and powerful corporate interests pulling the political strings. But necessarily, even a ""correct"" identification of ""the elites"" denigrates the humans that comprise this group to being ""enemies"" of the state  of a biblical nature, and often casts a blind eye to thoughts of violence against these groups, or actively encourages it. Populists draw all of the peoples' woes back to these elites, and argue that the solution to all problems, and the way forward, is the defeat of these elites, which the populist promises to bring.  The problem is twofold: one, as previously mentioned, the definition of who counts as ""the elites"" and ""the people"" can shift even within a single populist's regime, and judgment passed by mob rule is often wrong, despite ""mass appeal"" flirting with our democratic instincts. If populists were in control of everything in the 80s, mass appeal would dictate that ""the people"" want gay marriage to be illegal. That was in fact the case in most places. It's easy to enjoy the idea that ""the people"" decide things, e.g. with a popular vote, when that popular vote aligns with what you want. Assuming you're progressive, you are pleased to see that progressive opinions are becoming more commonplace as you pointed out. But it is not the popularity of opinion that makes it right, unless 2020 is the year that we suddenly know the right way to do everything. Agreeing on a definition of who are ""the elites"" and who are ""the people"" necessarily requires divisiveness, and while we may be bang on the money in 2020 as to who the elites are, there's no guarantee that it stays this way, and to subject ourselves to a system of always fighting whoever ""the elites"" are is a dangerous path.  Second, political candidates require divisiveness to distinguish themselves for voters. If it's true that 100% of people agree with higher minimum wages, then campaigning on increasing the minimum wage is an ineffective campaign. Due in large part to the media focusing on a handful of easy-to-digest social issues, polarization is at a peak; the idea of a ""conservative democrat"" or a ""liberal republican"" is so far gone that the terms are nearly considered oxymoronic by most. Democrats by and large support increasing the minimum wage, while many republicans do not. You say some things have ""wide support"" by the ""general populace."" By ""wide support"" I assume you mean >50% (most generous definition I guess), and by ""general populace"" I assume you mean both sides of the aisle. On some things you say has ""wide support"":  * On socialized healthcare: 60% of Americans say it's the governments responsibility to ensure healthcare coverage. Of the projected 253,768,092 American adults in 2018, to act on this ""widely supported"" opinion immediately would invalidate the opinion of roughly 101 million Americans. It's a partisan issue: 80% of democrats and 28% of republicans favor it. * On ""electoral reform"": the concept as stated is vague. Many Americans are probably unhappy with elections that don't elect their candidate. Ignoring that, let's assume you meant popular vote. 58% of Americans want popular vote to replace the electoral college. It's a partisan issue: 81% of democrats and 32% of republicans favor it. * On free trade: actually, 56% of Americans view free trade as a good thing (in 2018). It's *somewhat* a partisan issue: 67% of democrats and 43% of republicans favor free trade. * On the minimum wage increase: 67% of Americans favor an increase in the minimum wage. It's a partisan issue: 86% of democrats and 43% of republicans favor it.  In all of these cases, the democrats and republicans differ in what side of the argument receives their ""wide support."" The issues you mention in general remain divisive along party lines, not to mention the slough of social issues (e.g. abortion, gay marriage) across which there is also disagreement. The problem is that these issues don't have widespread agreement; they are highly partisan.  If republicans are some populist's ""elites,"" then it is easy to declare to your ""the people"" that these elites must be taken down; on social issues I agree (me being pro-choice, pro-marry-who-the-fuck-you-want). But surely you see that it's difficult and dangerous to invalidate 100 million Americans' opinions on things like how healthcare could be handled: there are some very strong arguments against socialized healthcare, as well as for; it's not one sided. Electoral reform: popular vote has a billion and one issues; of the 5 elections in which the popular vote-winner lost the electoral college, 5 were democrats, so it seems natural that democrats would like a popular vote, and it would be easy to shroud their justification for it in some righteous pursuit of the will of ""the people"" while totally forgetting the reasons we don't use a popular vote. Free trade: it actually has majority support, rather than protectionism as you suggest, and it's the least partisan issue you cited. Minimum wage increase: this has deleterious effects in rural areas, and the minimum wage can crowd out certain individuals who would otherwise not earn employment, threaten small business ventures, and further push for automation (when our government clearly is not ready to deal with its ramifications). I'm not saying the republican side of these issues is right; I'm just trying to advocate for the fact that it's not as simple as ""well, democrats want it, republicans don't, but 60% of Americans do on average and republicans are dumb, so screw it let's do it.""  I think instead of having a populist movement, you need popul*ar* candidates who push for the issues you want to see. Democratic candidates by and large do this because these issues are partisan and their voters want it. Republican candidates by and large do not do this because these issues are partisan and their voters don't want it.","

Human: CMV: America needs a populist political movement that focuses on widely agreed upon political and economic reforms instead of wedge issues and culture wars According to polling data there are a great many political and economic reforms that are widely supported by the general populace  and would be beneficial to the majority of Americans. Statistically most Americans support things like higher minimum wages, ending citizens united, a more socialized healthcare system, electoral reform, and an end to outsourcing and free trade agreements. However instead of focusing on these areas of common ground most politics and political movements focus on issues that are both widely divisive and much smaller in scope such as abortion, gun control, which bathrooms people should be allowed to use, and how different groups are represented in the media.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  The result of this is that people continue to be politically divided in spite of the large degree of common ground many of us have politically. By contrast an agenda of political and economic populism could both unite people and lead to real progress for many. Not only are political and economic reforms fairly universally supported, but they can also be argued for through appeals to rational self interest unlike a lot of wedge issues and culture war stuff which are heavily subjective and difficult to sway people on.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Obviously achieving this wouldn't be easy but I think it would still be the best way to achieve tangible progress on political and economic reform in this country instead of the perpetual gridlock we always seem to be in now.

Here’s a good explanation.  “The comma is everything when it comes to baking measurements.  Every cut, chop, or dice instruction after a comma in an ingredient list is to be done after the ingredient is measured.  For example, 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped.    In longhand, this means… go to the store and buy one of those four ounce bars of chocolate, probably that fancy bar of Ghirardelli that’s next to the chocolate chips in the baking aisle.  Buy it.  Take it home.  Unwrap it.  Try not to take a bite because you’re using it for brownies.  Put it on the counter.  Chop it.  Don’t sneak any bites.  We know it’s hard.  Place it in the bowl with the butter and follow the rest of the dang instructions.  These recipe list does not mean chop a bunch of chocolate and measure out 4 ounces and snack on the rest.”","

As you work out, your muscles are being destroyed.  That’s how it’s supposed to work though. They’re built this way so your body can replace the broken weaker, smaller fibres in your muscles with better, stronger, and thicker fibres. Due to the injury you’re sustaining + the actual activity you’re doing which requires more oxygen = more blood in muscles to feed the activity.  More blood swells the muscles hence the “pump” you get during the routine. Afterwards your muscles will be sore because they are now effectively an internal wound of sorts.  Again, designed for this. They then begin rebuilding within an hour or so of stopping your session at the gym or whatever.  Just as any wound would. The human body is an amazing system of countless smaller systems acting in sync to effectively create one combined unit.  Hope this helps.","

Yet, on the other hand, I would think it would be very surprising if such a highly specific and rather old intellectual tradition could survive so many huge cultural upheavals - the disruption of the unity of the unity of Catholicism and its institutional and linguistic connection to philosophical education in Europe *and the rest of the world* - especially while, in the usual way, people were writing critiques of all sorts of scholastic ideas and were increasingly going off to do their own things in lots of different intellectual directions in vernacular.","

Human: Why did medieval scholasticism fell out of favor? So I'm on a binge of scholastic philosophy, especially Thomas Aquinas. Long story short, I didn't begin so long ago but so far it seems like good reasoning, at least assuming that concepts like actuality-potentiality are correctly argued for.   However I don't really understand why this line of philosophy isn't explored as much in discussions about God's existence nowadays. When I searched for this, I just found vague claims about the scientific revolution ruining them(but no specifics as to how) or a Blaise Pascal quote that you can't know God with reason(but again, no further explanation). I think it's important because the thomistic arguments have a logic-oriented perspective but I've never seen an accurate ,,debunk"" of the arguments, except for strawmans.

rejected,-733.8638916015625,-727.2296142578125,-0.6634277701377869,474," There's a classical ""decline and fall"" narrative associated with the phrase ""decadent scholasticism."" The story goes that medieval scholasticism culminated in St. Thomas Aquinas, but his elegant system gave way to more cumbersome but sophisticated successors, who, eventually, began to buckle under tensions because their systems had become overly elaborate, evident for example in the writings of Bl. Duns Scotus. According to this narrative, the working out of unresolved tensions in high scholasticism became too abstruse, and finally William of Ockham, Gabriel Biel, and other nominalists exposed these errors. The confusion was finally swept away with the advent of modern philosophy in Descartes, who began things anew, apart from the overly complicated scholastic vocabulary.  I think most historians now accept that this is a highly ideologically motivated and largely inaccurate distortion of the actual history. Medieval scholasticism never really ""collapsed"" - rather, its fundamental problems and basic alternatives were formulated and reformulated over the centuries, without any moment of decisive discontinuity (Descartes, the great hero or villain of the ""decline and fall"" story, was, after all, trained by Jesuit scholastics, and elements of Suarezian Jesuit thought can be found in his works).  That said, there definitely was a prolonged transformation of European philosophy which eventually became more and more removed from its scholastic roots, and, in its self-interpretation, projected a moment of genealogical discontinuity onto the past (which, as historical tend to do, reveals much more about the self-interpretation of our present moment than it does about actual history). The most common explanation, I think, locates the cause of this transformation in nominalism: the relationship between mind and world that nominalism involves led (the standard narrative goes) to a set of skeptical worries concerning the possibility of knowledge, which of course are reflected in the basic Cartesian worry of the *Meditations*. This skeptical problem becomes the fundamental question of modern philosophy, and, in retrospect, Scholastic metaphysics seems naive and unconcerned with skepticism (when in fact the scholastics were for the most part - but not entirely - 'unconcerned' because they shared very different assumptions about the nature of mind and world).","

If you read many of the thinkers I mention below, you’ll see areas of direct engagement, like Hume’s argument against Aristotelian/Scholastic unactualized potentials. If you’re really interested, I suggest you check out Descartes, Locke, Hume, and Kant. Otherwise, you can check out Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy articles on particular topics and you’ll probably find a good discussion about historical trends and the arguments that facilitated change.  I’m not sure what really precipitated Descartes’ thought, except that he felt the Scholastics were mired in verbal disputes and had failed to make progress in science. Ultimately part of his philosophy was an attempt to ground the science that he later occupied himself with, so that could have been a major contributor to his motivation for critiquing Scholastics. Keep in mind that Descartes was a younger contemporary of Galileo, and he was aware of the Copernican revolution, which included Tycho Brahe’s observation of a comet crossing through what Aristotle had described as impassible celestial spheres. Aristotelian science was not only stagnant, it was falling apart before everyone’s eyes. And other people with other ideas were making progress.  For an overview of the philosophical side, Descartes and Locke challenged the place of the **Aristotelian syllogism** in reasoning, the former choosing to replace it with something like the geometric method and the latter opting for greater reliance on empirical support. In both cases, more work on **epistemology generally** was needed to replace the Aristotelian syllogism and its role in Scholastic epistemology, and emerging discoveries in optics refueled discussions about the relation of experience, epistemology, and direct/indirect realism and idealism. Moreover, both Descartes and Locke came up with revised doctrines about **substances/essences**, with Locke notably arguing that nominal essences alone are sufficient for our desiderata. It’s hard to understate the impact of switching from essentialism to nominalism on epistemology and metaphysics.  The application of geometric and empirical methods alongside other newfangled epistemological tools to causation led to interesting historical conversations with participants like Berkeley, Malebranche, Spinoza, Leibniz, Hume, Reid, and Kant, each of whom certainly brought some level of cultural spin. For example, Kant’s ethics are clearly influenced by his upbringing as a Pietist, while Leibniz was perpetually engaged with attempts to unite diverse views he happened to see sympathetically (including Protestant and Catholic views). So their works reflect not just straightforward counterarguments, but also the changing landscape of epistemology, the hot topics of the time, and whatever cultural values they appreciated or strained against.  Edit: and don’t forget the Renaissance! Scholastic thought had separate roots in ancient Christian thought and Aristotelian/Platonic thought. But it wasn’t until the Renaissance that the range of Ancient Greek thought was re-opened up to the world - Epicureanism and Skepticism had always been contenders against Aristotle and Plato’s scientific, ethical, and epistemological views. Although Scholastics had done a lot of work in their own branch of philosophy, it became difficult to ignore foundational critiques by other ancient thinkers, kind of like the way Enlightenment critiques of the Aristotelian syllogism, essentialism, and lessons from optics in epistemology were aimed at the foundations of Scholastic thought rather than the uppermost branches.  Another edit: You may appreciate this essay by C.S. Peirce. He’s a fan of the Scholastics, and discusses Berkeley’s nominalism in relationship to the medieval conversation about Universals, particularly between Scotus and Ockham.","

My reading is that nominalism and voluntarism, both which arose out of scholasticism itself, played major roles in dethroning Thomism (and to some extent Aristotelianism) as really the only legitimate explanation of metaphysics in the Western Christian world. See Michael Gillespie's *The Theological Origins of Modernity* for a treatment of this trajectory.  But Thomism/Aristotelianism didn't die, they simply became options among others, and parts of them feature today in respectable secular philosophical discourse. Causal powers views (e.g. Madden and Harre) are, or look awfully similar to, hylomorphism; (neo-) Aristotelian metaphysics in a broad sense has been popularized by folks like Tuomas Tahko; virtue theory that does (MacIntyre) or doesn't (Foot) make explicit reference to Aristotle and Aquinas is a live option in normative ethics. And of course natural kinds/classes have a resemblance to teleology.","

The most common explanation, I think, locates the cause of this transformation in nominalism: the relationship between mind and world that nominalism involves led (the standard narrative goes) to a set of skeptical worries concerning the possibility of knowledge, which of course are reflected in the basic Cartesian worry of the *Meditations*. This skeptical problem becomes the fundamental question of modern philosophy, and, in retrospect, Scholastic metaphysics seems naive and unconcerned with skepticism (when in fact the scholastics were for the most part - but not entirely - 'unconcerned' because they shared very different assumptions about the nature of mind and world).","

Human: Why did medieval scholasticism fell out of favor? So I'm on a binge of scholastic philosophy, especially Thomas Aquinas. Long story short, I didn't begin so long ago but so far it seems like good reasoning, at least assuming that concepts like actuality-potentiality are correctly argued for.   However I don't really understand why this line of philosophy isn't explored as much in discussions about God's existence nowadays. When I searched for this, I just found vague claims about the scientific revolution ruining them(but no specifics as to how) or a Blaise Pascal quote that you can't know God with reason(but again, no further explanation). I think it's important because the thomistic arguments have a logic-oriented perspective but I've never seen an accurate ,,debunk"" of the arguments, except for strawmans. Does someone know an explanation?

They have Treaties that were signed between their tribes and the Government of Canada which laid out both sides of the deal - what they got in exchange for moving to a designated area and completely changing their way of life. These are still legal documents just like a  Constitution - they are valid as long as 'rivers flow and grass grows'. At no point do the First Nations rights suddenly expire.   In America, this might have happened occasionally but American Indians fought back and were conquered. Agreements were made after the fact.   After those Treaties were signed, the problems have largely stemmed from interpretations. The Indians couldn't necessarily read, they have a different culture and different understanding. The translations were murky at best. The Indian Act is another factor which is where all the laws associated with Indian treatment are laid out. They are pretty harsh. While they may not have to pay income tax (while working on the reservation) they also cannot build their own house on that land, they are essentially rented. Any buildings or businesses need Indian Agent approval. Also look up Residential Schools.   Everyone who has immigrated to Canada since day 1 has come after it was already established by the Indians and Inuit. We are all living on their land (Turtle Island), according to signed legal documents, and everyone should respect that. Time doesn't erase everything.

Human: Can someone explain contemporary race laws and race-based policies in North America (USA and Canada), such as affirmative action and tax exemption for native Americans? Why are these laws not considered racist/discriminatory? (Not intended to be inflammatory, respectful discussion please) I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, so please shoot me down if I'm ruining your wonderful sub (although if you could point me in the right direction first, I'd greatly appreciate it).  My question is not intended to be racist or inflammatory, and at the risk of sounding condescending I'd like to plead for discussion to be civil and for upvotes etc. to be alloted by reason rather than emotion. I'd also like to clarify that I am not North American, but recently visited a relative of mine in Canada and learnt, in broad strokes, about the race laws there. I'd like to share the experience as it adds context to my question; feel free to skip to the end to see my question on its own.  I visited my cousin when he got married in Toronto. He's white and Irish (1st gen immigrant), and his girlfriend is also white, originally from the Ukraine. They had lived there for about 10 years. She worked as a teacher on a Native American (or American Indian, I'm afraid I don't know what term is appropriate, apologies if I cause offense) reservation (I think she used a better name for it, apologies again). I was quite surprised by many things I learnt. According to her, many people in the native community are exempt from various taxes, and receive free education up to and including University (unlike other Canadians in that prefecture), and also benefit from various other favoritist policies based on race. However, to qualify for the full benefits (which could include ownership of land), you had to be at least n% American Indian - if your bloodline was too watered down, you no longer qualified.  I was quite surprised by this, because it didn't seem fair at all. First of all, there's something a bit grim about your birth (and your % indigenous blood) determining your relationship to the state etc.; I like to think that in a developed country, the law, rights, and duties should apply to all equally regardless of race. I was also distressed by my relative's reaction to my surprise. They reasoned that since they were white, it was fair - they'd oppressed the Indians in their own day, and it was time to pay reparations. However, this argument didn't make sense to me. First of all, many taxpayers (who are footing the bill for indigenous privilege) are non-white. They might be Japanese Canadians, who were hideously mistreated very recently, or just recent immigrants from China or Bangladesh who've never done anything wrong to the indigenous people. I also pointed out that a Ukrainian and an Irishman have also probably done nothing wrong (historically speaking) - heck, almost no-one suffered so much at the hands of the British as the Irish, and Ukraine hasn't exactly had a fun 150 years either. Finally, I pointed out that really, guilt shouldn't be inherited, and race laws don't really have a place in a first world country.  My relatives reaction is what surprised me the most, and what lead me to ask this question. They became very defensive and actually angry at me. I honestly felt as if they'd been brainwashed. I must admit, I don't understand the Canadian educational system at all, but it seems like it's trying to make people feel guilt - or worse, actually BE guilty - of crimes they have not committed. What is also strange is that they objected to my use of the term 'race law' in reference to laws which specifically stipulate different treatment by the law based on race.  I am given to understand that the USA has similar policies, for instance permitting Native Americans to circumvent various state and federal laws, again based on bloodline (Casinos spring to mind).  I was surprised to discover that Canada and the USA have different legal treatment for different races, and I have the impression that mainstream society doesn't question this much. Am I correct in that impression? What is the discussion in the field of social science of the validity of having 'preferred' races, 'tax exempt' races, etc.? Doesn't serious social science frown upon 'race' as a construct anyway, and if so, why hasn't that attitude permeated society as a whole? Finally, is opposing such policies considered racist?  TL;DR: Explain race laws in Canada and the USA, affirmative action, and social attitudes towards the same; please remain civil! (although obviously if you think I'm a monstrous racist, please tell me! I'm moving to the USA soon and want to be careful not to offend anyone in that country.)

Human: Quit my summer job I’ve been working at for 3 years without notice. Boss cut my last TWO checks. Is this legal? (TX) I’ve been working as a seasonal employee for the last three years, and I recently decided to quit without notice.  An event came up three days before my shift and we’re supposed to provide written notice seven days in advance for a shift that needs to be covered. If this isn’t done, it’s a no-show, and a no-show is an automatic fire. An automatic fire is considered leaving without notice, so I jumped the gun and quit preemptively.  When I told my employer about my resignation, I was redirected to our hire packet, which has a clause that states that any quit/fire without notice is an automatic pay cut to minimum wage for all hours that have been unpaid. I was supposed to be paid for three weeks in two separate checks/pay periods as of the day I resigned, one for two weeks I had already worked and another for the two days before I quit. My employer cut my pay for both of them to minimum wage. I’m not sure if cutting pay is legal at all in the first place, and if it is i’m not sure if cutting pay for two separate pay periods, including one that had already been completed, is legal.

If this isn’t done, it’s a no-show, and a no-show is an automatic fire. An automatic fire is considered leaving without notice, so I jumped the gun and quit preemptively.  When I told my employer about my resignation, I was redirected to our hire packet, which has a clause that states that any quit/fire without notice is an automatic pay cut to minimum wage for all hours that have been unpaid. I was supposed to be paid for three weeks in two separate checks/pay periods as of the day I resigned, one for two weeks I had already worked and another for the two days before I quit. My employer cut my pay for both of them to minimum wage.

Clones are deadly accurate with blasters. I'd say the only thing they're not really on par with is with hand to hand combat. But Clones are trained to be soldiers fighting their enemies with blasters, not fighting with hand to hand combat. So naturally they're not going to get as much melee combat training. Also, let's not forget that Jango and Boba have all of their equipment like Rockets, Flamethrowers, wrist blasters, jet-packs, ect. That adds their combat effectiveness.","

Police have the power to use discretion in determining whether to enforce the law in many situations and arrest a person or to use some other form of enforcement. Every time police pull someone over for speeding but don't write them a ticket, they are using officer discretion. Discretion is able to be used at all levels of the law, from police and corrections officers to prosecutors to judges and jurors. It keeps the system from being bogged down and it allows them to selectively enforce laws which are minor offenses or outdated. For example, section 13A-12-1 of Alabama law prohibits having your store open if you do not call within one of the exceptions. However, this is clearly an outdated law and would be extremely unlikely to be enforced by any police.   Second, you are ignoring the spirit of the law. Many people within the criminal justice system follow the idea that when working in the law, one must enforce the spirit of the law, or what is intended with the placement of the law, rather than the letter of the law, or literal interpretation. For example, take 2907.03 of Ohio law.   > (A) No person shall engage in sexual conduct with another, not the spouse of the offender, when any of the following apply:  > (2) The offender knows that the other person's ability to appraise the nature of or control the other person's own conduct is substantially impaired.  Now, we know what this means. Don't intoxicate someone to the point where their ability to make judgements are impaired and then have sex with them. This is a measure to prevent people from being sexually taken advantage of in such states. However, that doesn't mean you go around arresting every single person who has sex with a drunk person.   Look at 2907.06 as well.   > (A) No person shall have sexual contact with another, not the spouse of the offender; cause another, not the spouse of the offender, to have sexual contact with the offender; or cause two or more other persons to have sexual contact when any of the following applies:  > (1) The offender knows that the sexual contact is offensive to the other person, or one of the other persons, or is reckless in that regard.  So, basically, don't go around groping people who don't want to be groped. Simple, right? Well, does this mean we should arrest the guy who comes up behind his wife and grabs her breast, but because she is mad that he forgot to take the garbage out, pulls away? No, because there is a certain level of comfort they have there and it was something he probably figured he could do in the first place without issue.   (For anyone who might respond to that, I'm not going to debate you on the concepts of affirmative consent. Yeah, you need consent before doing this kind of stuff in many cases, but let's be reasonable here. Spouses and people in serious, sexual relationships rarely need to do so every single time. Obviously, a person should stop if it is unwanted, etc.)  The point is that police do not need to enforce every single law to the exact letter of the law in all cases. They are allowed to use their own discretion with regards to many crimes, including those of laws they do not agree with. They also, arguably, have a moral obligation not to enforce all laws in the most strict and literal sense of the laws. As such, a person can become a cop and stay on as a cop without violating their own moral codes or being morally reprehensible even if they disagree with some laws.","

They can let someone off with a warning who was speeding, if two people get into a barfight they can charge them with disturbing the peace and refuse to charge them with battery even though they are both guilty of battery, etc.  They aren't fully and completely enforcing the law in these situations, are these bad cops? I would argue that they are not because by their very interactions in these scenarios they have helped enforce the spirit of the law. The driver most likely won't be speeding as much as often, the two drunks probably won't get into any more fights, etc.  Of course there are some laws that come into play that police do not agree with, but they still have discretion.  It is unreasonable to expect police to not exhibit bias within their day-to-day application of the law. Which is why it isn't expected, and universally accepted that the police will use their personal judgement when applying the law.","

Police do not get to choose which laws they enforce, they must enforce all laws they are given jurisdiction over.  Laws can change and enforcement strategies or enforcement tactics can change.

Police have the power to use discretion in determining whether to enforce the law in many situations and arrest a person or to use some other form of enforcement. Every time police pull someone over for speeding but don't write them a ticket, they are using officer discretion. Discretion is able to be used at all levels of the law, from police and corrections officers to prosecutors to judges and jurors. It keeps the system from being bogged down and it allows them to selectively enforce laws which are minor offenses or outdated. For example, section 13A-12-1 of Alabama law prohibits having your store open if you do not call within one of the exceptions. However, this is clearly an outdated law and would be extremely unlikely to be enforced by any police.   Second, you are ignoring the spirit of the law. Many people within the criminal justice system follow the idea that when working in the law, one must enforce the spirit of the law, or what is intended with the placement of the law, rather than the letter of the law, or literal interpretation. For example, take 2907.03 of Ohio law.   > (A) No person shall engage in sexual conduct with another, not the spouse of the offender, when any of the following apply:  > (2) The offender knows that the other person's ability to appraise the nature of or control the other person's own conduct is substantially impaired.  Now, we know what this means. Don't intoxicate someone to the point where their ability to make judgements are impaired and then have sex with them. This is a measure to prevent people from being sexually taken advantage of in such states. However, that doesn't mean you go around arresting every single person who has sex with a drunk person.   Look at 2907.06 as well.   > (A) No person shall have sexual contact with another, not the spouse of the offender; cause another, not the spouse of the offender, to have sexual contact with the offender; or cause two or more other persons to have sexual contact when any of the following applies:  > (1) The offender knows that the sexual contact is offensive to the other person, or one of the other persons, or is reckless in that regard.  So, basically, don't go around groping people who don't want to be groped. Simple, right? Well, does this mean we should arrest the guy who comes up behind his wife and grabs her breast, but because she is mad that he forgot to take the garbage out, pulls away? No, because there is a certain level of comfort they have there and it was something he probably figured he could do in the first place without issue.   (For anyone who might respond to that, I'm not going to debate you on the concepts of affirmative consent. Yeah, you need consent before doing this kind of stuff in many cases, but let's be reasonable here. Spouses and people in serious, sexual relationships rarely need to do so every single time. Obviously, a person should stop if it is unwanted, etc.)  The point is that police do not need to enforce every single law to the exact letter of the law in all cases. They are allowed to use their own discretion with regards to many crimes, including those of laws they do not agree with. They also, arguably, have a moral obligation not to enforce all laws in the most strict and literal sense of the laws. As such, a person can become a cop and stay on as a cop without violating their own moral codes or being morally reprehensible even if they disagree with some laws.","

If a jailer is absolutely sure a prisoner is innocent of the crime for which he is imprisoned, the jailer would have a moral imperative to release the prisoner.  However, if jailers are allowed to release prisoners because of what they think, then the system falls apart.   Since a world in which jailers will keep innocent prisoners is better than a world where jailers release prisoners they think are innocent, then it is morally permissible for a jailer to jail someone they think is innocent.  ___  Now there are more intricacies to the theory.

Anarchy is worse than the occasional bad law. So it's better for people to be police.  There are a few problems with that argument. For one it doesn't address selective enforcement, but that has been addressed elsewhere and I think I can ignore it here. Also, if everyone was following that advice, then they're presumably not the sort of people that would be criminals. But it seems like a bad idea to only let potential criminals be police. Also, everyone acting in what they personally believe to be the most moral manner can still be worse than order. For example, maybe 99% of the population thinks there should be a bridge somewhere, but 1% think there should not, so they keep knocking it down. It would be better to get people to vote on what they prefer and then not worry about if it's a good idea on an individual basis.","

If his real identity was known then people would either not be afraid of him or he'd be directly targetted (as has happened in Injustice and Arkham Knight).  Peter still has people he cares about for deeply and if anyone knew who he was, they'd be targetted by criminals in order to punish him. For example, the Green Goblin found out that Gwen Stacy was linked to him and he kidnapped her to lure Spidey into a trap, leading to her death.  There's also at least two storylines where the Kingpin found out Spider-Man's identity and harmed/killed someone he cared for. In canon, someone tipped off the Kingpin about his being Peter Parker and he hired a sniper who wounded Mary Jane - in an issue of *What If?*, the sniper killed her instead which resulted in Spider-Man going on a warpath to kill Fisk.  Fisk ended up turning himself into the authorities for protection under the stipulend that an Avenger protect him from Spider-Man. This resulted in Iron Man going to fight Spidey... only for Peter to reveal that he had a remote shutdown secretly installed into his suit (this was years before this was confirmed to be canon, BTW). Then Fisk hired some dirty cops to hold May hostage to make him surrender. Spidey punched straight through Fisk's chest, ripped his heart out and told the cops that since they're no longer getting paid, they might as well leave! Then he lets the honest cops take him into custody.  In another storyline (which was canon), after Spidey's identity was made public, Fisk sent some goons around to rough up Aunt May, in such a way that it couldn't be tied to him (Fisk was in jail at the time). Peter then proceeded to break *into* jail, beat Fisk black and blue and explained how he could kill him by drowning him in web fluid. Which will happen if he hurts any of Peter's family or associates.","

If his real identity was known then people would either not be afraid of him or he'd be directly targetted (as has happened in Injustice and Arkham Knight).  Peter still has people he cares about for deeply and if anyone knew who he was, they'd be targetted by criminals in order to punish him. For example, the Green Goblin found out that Gwen Stacy was linked to him and he kidnapped her to lure Spidey into a trap, leading to her death.  There's also at least two storylines where the Kingpin found out Spider-Man's identity and harmed/killed someone he cared for. In canon, someone tipped off the Kingpin about his being Peter Parker and he hired a sniper who wounded Mary Jane - in an issue of *What If?*, the sniper killed her instead which resulted in Spider-Man going on a warpath to kill Fisk.  Fisk ended up turning himself into the authorities for protection under the stipulend that an Avenger protect him from Spider-Man. This resulted in Iron Man going to fight Spidey... only for Peter to reveal that he had a remote shutdown secretly installed into his suit (this was years before this was confirmed to be canon, BTW). Then Fisk hired some dirty cops to hold May hostage to make him surrender. Spidey punched straight through Fisk's chest, ripped his heart out and told the cops that since they're no longer getting paid, they might as well leave! Then he lets the honest cops take him into custody.  In another storyline (which was canon), after Spidey's identity was made public, Fisk sent some goons around to rough up Aunt May, in such a way that it couldn't be tied to him (Fisk was in jail at the time). Peter then proceeded to break *into* jail, beat Fisk black and blue and explained how he could kill him by drowning him in web fluid. Which will happen if he hurts any of Peter's family or associates.","

No Way Home was a whole movie about the consequences of Spidey losing his secret identity and the fallout that occurred. Even before the spell went wrong, the revelation put Peter and his friends/family through the wringer.   Tony Stark revealed his identity out of cockiness in Iron Man 1, and as a result had a target put on his back by Whiplash in IM2 and Killian in IM3 (who directly attacked his home, no less, nearly getting Pepper killed as well).   If you're not going to rock a secret identity, you'd better be able to handle the consequences of that. Cap, Wanda, Natasha, Vision, Bucky, etc all laid low after Civil War (and before the Snap), and Clint seemed to keep his family more or less off the grid to keep them safe.","

When you're basically a god among men, you feel isolated from the world. Secret identites help them connect with normal people, and live a normal life.  Tony Stark in the MCU is kind of the opposite. He is a man among gods. He wants credit for his super deeds, because he loves the feeling of pride and being idolized. It's also a testament to his cockiness. This is who I am, this is where I live. Come and get me.  But in the comics, Tony did originally have a secret identity (so did Thor.) In the beginning even the avengers thought the iron man was Tony's bodyguard. This was probably to keep the facade of the playboy billionaire while still making bad guys aware that Stark Industries was protected.  Spider-Man has always kept his identity a secret. He began heroing as a kid, so the first person he kept the secret from was his guardian Aunt May. Obviously, it's not like she would approve of her underage nephew fighting giant rhinoercus men and ceos in rubber masks. Then as his career grew, he realized how much risk those he loved would be in if his enemies ever found out who he was. In a few stories, his identity has been revealed to results much more tragic than not getting into MIT. He doesn't have the money, brains, and resources to protect those he cares about constantly like Tony can, so having his identity known is much riskier.   Batman has his own reasons for the secret identity. Most heroes maintain them to protect their loved ones, but I don't think that's his main motivation. The man is known to adopt children and bring them into the same dangers he faces. He also has no big civilian love interest to protect like Superman, and no living family (besides Alfred.)  He has the money and brains to put his home on high security like Stark, so why doesn't he just come out and say that he is the Batman? Because Batman is a symbol, an otherworldly force of justice that haunts the streets of Gotham. He works in the dark that is everywhere, and fear of him is a deterrent to criminals in his territory. If the underworld of Gotham found out the Bat is just a reclusive billionaire who never got over his dead parents, they would lose respect for him. More importantly, it would lift the veil of mystery and fear that surrounds him. Batman's identity has to be secret for him to be an effective crime fighter.  TL;DR - there's lots of reasons to have a secret identity that vary from hero to hero and writer to writer, but it's usually to keep people from killing your family.","

Let's take a look at a few you have listed.     **Iron Man** \- Not only does Iron Man have an obscene amount of money but he has powerful connections to Government entities. As an Avenger his crimefighting is sanctioned by the US Government. In the MCU he is also a bit of a narcissist who doesn't really care about the collateral damage this might cause, resulting in the problems of Iron Man 3 when his house is destoyed by the fake Mandarin.     **Spiderman** \- While he does team up with the Avengers and other groups from time to time, his usual schtick is street level vigilantism (i.e. fighting criminal gangs and the occassional supercriminal).       In his case he doesn't have the financial resources of Stark to protect him or his loved ones from social and criminal reprisals if exposed.  In Spiderman: No Way Home we see how his identity being exposed costs him and his friends from getting admitted to their dream school.  In the comics, he also revealed his identity at one point resulting in Aunt May getting attacked.     **Batman** \- Batman may be extremely wealthy, however his brand of superheroism is technically vigilantism, operating on the gray side of the law. Unlike Tony Stark who uses the Iron Man persona as a rebranding tool for Stark Technology (shifting from building weapons to helping people), Wayne Enterprises would suffer reprisals if its CEO was discovered dressing as a Bat to harass criminals without due process.     Also, revealing his identity would put the Bat Family at heightened risk to the likes of the Joker and similar supercriminals.     **Superman** \- Superman's alter ego is more focused on maintaining privacy. As someone raised by humble farmers in Kansas, I think Superman doesn't always want to deal with the publicity of being the Man of Steel. Sometimes he just wants to feel human.      So in closing:     A) Superheroes who are public usually have the benefit of either being sanctioned heroes with the resources and protection of the government at their disposal.     B) Vigilantes typically need to hide their identities to protect themselves against social, governmental, and criminal reprisals.      C) Others have a secret identity either for a sense of privacy and to better fit in to mortal society.","

But what you're missing is that the way we are perceived by the world ultimately shapes our experiences, and our experiences play a role in the forming of our ideas.   Take Bernie Sanders' press secretary Symone Sanders for example. If you put her in a room with 11 white women who also worked on the campaign you're obviously going to find overlap in political beliefs. But by being a black woman, her experiences, and therefore her perspective, will vary in certain ways due to her unique experience. Despite working on the same campaign, the white women would not have experienced the same level of bias and discrimination that Symone did due to her race. And that alone will contribute to the diversity of experience/ideas that she brings to the table despite their shared political beliefs.

Human: CMV: Real diversity is the acceptance of anyone, the current debate on diversity is demonstrative of the fact that, overall, we still judge everyone based on what is observable just by looking at them, our goals of diversity are fake, it's just to make things 'look' different. Recently when that woman from Apple resigned after saying that 12 white men in a room could be diverse because of their experiences I had a sudden epiphany for what may be wrong with conversations on diversity these days.  To me, the central issue is that our understanding of diversity is only 'observable' diversity.     I've lived and worked in many different cities, especially those with diverse populations such as Singapore, Doha, New York and London.

My point is that if our only understanding of diversity is based on what can be initially observed about someone, then what the hell are we really talking about? This person has X colored skin, this person has Y disability, this person has Z political perspective or W religion as seen by an artifact on their body? What the heck? Aren't we better than that?

From my experience, you could dream up the most incredibly diverse board of directors, representing somehow through mixed blood every minority race, religion, disability and personal diet and if they all have the same tactics in common, you'll have a LESS diverse output of strategy from that executive suite. Real diversity is accepting everyone, making things more colorful/differently shaped is an attempt at a shortcut that ultimately doesn't make sense.

You should analyse the core of your views and the thinking behind it the same way you do opposing ones. Don’t give your view any extra logic points because you came up with it.   Onto the point:   When it comes to certian careers it is important that diversity is a thing. This is to get different views and it helps companies watch over themselves. For example, this is important in tv show and movie casting.   Say, you are a casting director for a big movie. The casting notes don’t mention anything about race. Race is not an important feature for this movie. Let’s say you are white.   You will have a (somewhat) natural bias to white people. Because when you read the characters the imaginary person you build in your head will almost always resemble people you know closest. Which is usually yourself and friends and family. This can lean to you choosing a white actor because of the image your thought in your head not because of merit.   This isn’t because the casting director is racist. And this doesn’t mean all white actors are picked because of white casting directors. It is a natural psychlogical thing.   So, a company might want to ensure that black actors aren’t being UNINTENTIONALLY discriminated agaisnt in the hiring process. They want every actor to be screened equally. So they want a black casting director as well to work alongside the white one. This is relevant for marketting, writing, and similar careers to ensure there is no unintentional biases.  With google it is a completly different issue (trust me the issue of women and STEM is never ending).   This is another unintentional thing. Let’s say the boss is a man and the underlings are a mix of men and women. Let’s say the underlings all perform the same. The boss gets told by his boss he needs to promote someone. Who does he promote? Well, in all likeliness, it is going to be a male underling. For much the same reasons as the white casting director.   With Google having a lot of issues with male superiors (and male underlings) devaluing women and not understanding unique problems towards women it is understandable why a woman wouldn’t feel the most comfortable in a room full of 12 men trying to talk about a unique woman issue or talking about unintentional sexism.   Because no one wants to be called racist or sexist. And the casting director and the boss aren’t racists or sexists. They have unintentional biases that it helps to have someone on the other end of that bias to be there to level and question them.   This is all about giving people equal opportunities. We can’t ignore unintentional biases because that restricts the equal opportunities. We should know they happen and think of ways around them. And that would be having a casting director with different ethnicities and having the hiring process at a firm be a diverse process.","

Diversity includes the desire to address _prejudice_ and to my knowledge it's difficult to find a historical bias in relation to access to boards of directors based on one being a lover of golf vs. model railroads.  Your position seems detached from the _reason_ we talk about diversity on cultural and visual level - because the world has a history (and a present!) of judging people, categorizing them and granting or preventing access for them based upon those cultural and visual elements of people. If we turn ""diversity"" into absolutely any dimension of difference then we're forgetting that the goal of diversity is rooted in address  _an actual problem_ in our society and that  problem itself involves bias towards ""the visual"".   Denying  this bias would do no good, and it seems disingenuous to me to acknowledge and respond to that bias and have doing so result in saying we're calling out skin color as ""important"".  Of course it's important - because  people are racist!  You know what they aren't?  Biased against people who ride motorcycles that  are on fire!","

You should analyse the core of your views and the thinking behind it the same way you do opposing ones. Don’t give your view any extra logic points because you came up with it.   Onto the point:   When it comes to certian careers it is important that diversity is a thing. This is to get different views and it helps companies watch over themselves. For example, this is important in tv show and movie casting.   Say, you are a casting director for a big movie. The casting notes don’t mention anything about race. Race is not an important feature for this movie. Let’s say you are white.   You will have a (somewhat) natural bias to white people. Because when you read the characters the imaginary person you build in your head will almost always resemble people you know closest. Which is usually yourself and friends and family. This can lean to you choosing a white actor because of the image your thought in your head not because of merit.   This isn’t because the casting director is racist. And this doesn’t mean all white actors are picked because of white casting directors. It is a natural psychlogical thing.   So, a company might want to ensure that black actors aren’t being UNINTENTIONALLY discriminated agaisnt in the hiring process. They want every actor to be screened equally. So they want a black casting director as well to work alongside the white one. This is relevant for marketting, writing, and similar careers to ensure there is no unintentional biases.  With google it is a completly different issue (trust me the issue of women and STEM is never ending).   This is another unintentional thing. Let’s say the boss is a man and the underlings are a mix of men and women. Let’s say the underlings all perform the same. The boss gets told by his boss he needs to promote someone. Who does he promote? Well, in all likeliness, it is going to be a male underling. For much the same reasons as the white casting director.   With Google having a lot of issues with male superiors (and male underlings) devaluing women and not understanding unique problems towards women it is understandable why a woman wouldn’t feel the most comfortable in a room full of 12 men trying to talk about a unique woman issue or talking about unintentional sexism.   Because no one wants to be called racist or sexist. And the casting director and the boss aren’t racists or sexists. They have unintentional biases that it helps to have someone on the other end of that bias to be there to level and question them.   This is all about giving people equal opportunities. We can’t ignore unintentional biases because that restricts the equal opportunities. We should know they happen and think of ways around them. And that would be having a casting director with different ethnicities and having the hiring process at a firm be a diverse process.","

Human: CMV: Real diversity is the acceptance of anyone, the current debate on diversity is demonstrative of the fact that, overall, we still judge everyone based on what is observable just by looking at them, our goals of diversity are fake, it's just to make things 'look' different. Recently when that woman from Apple resigned after saying that 12 white men in a room could be diverse because of their experiences I had a sudden epiphany for what may be wrong with conversations on diversity these days.  To me, the central issue is that our understanding of diversity is only 'observable' diversity.     I've lived and worked in many different cities, especially those with diverse populations such as Singapore, Doha, New York and London. One thing I've learned is to never assume anything about anyone.

The only way to give orders was a trumpet and drums, so was for centuries. The enemy could simply copy your trumpet and give false orders to your troops. So you bring a giant flag close to the trumpet and your soldier would obey only to orders coming from the trumpet below the big flag.  Army business is mostly marching, and less than 1% fighting. So now you have big flags and drums and trumpets, someone may say: let’s use them to cheer up the troops while walking thousand miles with 30-50kg backpacks.  Then why not, let’s use that on parades and cerimonial events. “If we show we have a great band and shiny flags, we are intrinsically showing we know how to do military stuff properly”  This being done for thousands of years, so it stick to the army culture.   If you have to show you are good, show you can play the music better than everyone else while you march at god speed, carry a fantastic huge flag for extra points.  https://youtu.be/ZRVS4XxSn9Q","

In addition to ceremonies and troop entertainment that has already been mentioned, we are often used for ""soft diplomacy."" We can go places where regular troops couldn't. My unit had played in Red Square (before I got there.) We were supposed to go to Moscow again, then Russia invaded Crimea, so we couldn't. But our replacement mission was Latvia. We were able to be a military presence to our allies near Russia, let them know the US hadn't forgotten about them, but in a way that wouldn't trigger Russia.   Also background music during state dinners, recruitment, parades, ""friendship"" concerts in foreign countries, etc. The military is actually the largest employer of musicians in the US.   We do go through basic training, with the exception of The Presidents Own. When deployed, often used as gate guards and the like. I have also done such fun tasks as clean a moat and sandbag a fort for a hurricane. We have to keep our physical fitness up and qualify on the rifle twice a year. Depending on the service depends on how much musician to how much soldier you are. Air Force is more musician than Airmen.  Marines are mainly Marines that sometimes get to play their instruments.","

Dopamine is used in the brain to help you exploit the resources in your environment. It does this by coding for reward expectations (""I expect a small reward for opening the fridge""). When an event deviates from baseline expectations (for better or for worse) dopamine responds strongly, in order to update your expectations. It thus acts as an indicator of progress. If you prevented dopamine signals from occurring in a rat, it wouldn't be motivated to seek out an available source of food. But if you put the food in its mouth, it would happily eat it.  If you want to get all technical, then we could say that our brains are (probably) Bayesian and that they are trying to avoid unexpected states by building mental models and making predictions about the future so they won't be surprised. Surprise, in this case, is bad. It means something is beyond your control. Things being beyond your control is dangerous. Dopamine is used to predict outcomes so that you will have an edge.  So the reason why some things ""feel good"" is that you are evolutionarily incentivized to exploit the resources of your environment. When something registers as such, it's going to feel good.  You are roaming around the world improving your mental model of your surroundings with the biologically prepared goal of extracting rewards and avoiding terrors and to hopefully create a copy of yourself who can do the same.  ""Feel-good chemicals"" are steering you toward desirable states.","

Happiness, as with all of your experiences, is a computation in your brain; your brain is integrating a bunch of inputs and saying that those inputs are good, and you experience this as happiness. Since happiness is just computation, and computation requires neurotransmission, happiness also requires neurotransmission.  Not all neurotransmitters are interchangeable. Some neurotransmitters send one message, some send another, and some send different messages based on the context of their transmission. In addition, different neurons have different preferences for different neurotransmitters. Put all this together and you end up finding that some neurotransmitters are associated with particular kinds of computation, and in this way dopamine is associated with happiness.  So it's not that dopamine makes you happy, it's that dopamine is an essential part of what happiness actually is, as a physical process in the brain.","

I'm asking because I'll be giving my notice this week to take an offer at another firm, and I'm wondering if there's some professional etiquette that I'm not understanding.  I did some searching online before asking this question, and the only discussion I could find on the topic was suggesting that it's fine to tell your current manager where you're going unless you believe that they will try to contact your new employer and sabotage your offer. I absolutely cannot imagine my manager doing that, so I still feel perplexed why my old coworkers kept the location of their new job a secret.  Thanks for your advice.

Step 1 is to save up chicken bones ( carcass, neck, meat litterally anything) then you wanna wash them until your water runs crystal clear. After that throw in some onion rosemary sage thyme celery carrots shallots pepper corns bayleaves and whatever else you wanna try experiment its alot of fun! Put all of these is a cheese cloth tied to your pot for easy removal later. Then you wanna heat the water up to a simmer and skim whatever gunk comes to the surface with a spoon or mesh. After like 2 hours you shouldn't have to worry about it but for those 2 hours check up on it and skim it every 20 mins or so. After that just let it go i usually do overnight but 6-8 hours is usually fine just check it make sure the water hasnt evaporated away too much but no need to babysit it ( i litterally leave the building  for the night tho i use a steam kettle so no fire hazard there do what you feel is safe) then you gotta strain it out now is also the time to portion if you want. I use a mesh strainer and cheese cloth the finer the better. Be sure to go SLOW there is a layer of fat at the top and that is good stuff but not for the stock so you have 2 options. 1 you can stop straining when you see fat bubbles and set the fat aside for later use. 2 you can strain the whole thing then let cool in fridge and the fat will become solid and you can pull it iff the top like a stick of butter. Finally add some salt if you want and bam you got that good clear chicken stock that will make your whole house smell like bomb ass chicken noodle soup","

Human: What killed my(30M) nephew(19M)? Hey everyone!  As the title said, my nephew died unexpectedly 16 days ago, and we have no idea how. We are still waiting for the autopsy report, but our family is obviously grieving and the uncertainty is killing us. Therefore im turning to you, in order order for, even if it's very little, information. I will do my best in explaining the whole situation. Im also an CRNA and therefore have some medical knowledge.   My nephew was a typical teenager. Just finished high school, didn't have a job yet. Was up all night gaming and sleeping all day. Had alot of friends, was a very kind-hearted person. Had no known medical issues apart from being born pre-mature and having ADD. According to his little sister and some friends, after the incident, he occasionally took Lyrica as recreational drug use, but very certain that there was no other drugs.   The night he died he hung out with two friends. The friend suspected that he had taken Lyrica before arriving at their place, but that he got more normal as the night progressed. All they did was playing video games and watching movies. At 5 in the morning my nephew texted his little sister that he was coming home at around 11-12 and then they all went to bed (all three slept in the same bed).   At 11 the friend's father enters the room and finds my nephew on the floor stone-cold dead. Probably been dead for a few hours. Anyway they all freaked out and started CPR and called 911. When help arrived they worked on him for about 30 minutes before going to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.  About a week later I called the pathology lab asking if there was any information. I didn't talk to a doctor but the person read from some report that there were no structural causes for the sudden death. Heart was normal, no ruptures etc. The lungs were abit enlarged and that the brain weighed too much (cerebral edema?). They have taken samples and biopsies that's been sent away for analyzing.   We're at a loss here... I have two scenarios in my head. First, he just died. Sudden cardiac death without structural cause (cardiomyopathy etc), maybe caused by some recreational drug. Second, he OD'd on opiates and fell out of bed and stopped breathing. This however feels so out of character for him. It also seem strange to take something just before going to bed.

The night he died he hung out with two friends. The friend suspected that he had taken Lyrica before arriving at their place, but that he got more normal as the night progressed. All they did was playing video games and watching movies. At 5 in the morning my nephew texted his little sister that he was coming home at around 11-12 and then they all went to bed (all three slept in the same bed).   At 11 the friend's father enters the room and finds my nephew on the floor stone-cold dead. Probably been dead for a few hours. Anyway they all freaked out and started CPR and called 911. When help arrived they worked on him for about 30 minutes before going to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.  About a week later I called the pathology lab asking if there was any information. I didn't talk to a doctor but the person read from some report that there were no structural causes for the sudden death. Heart was normal, no ruptures etc. The lungs were abit enlarged and that the brain weighed too much (cerebral edema?). They have taken samples and biopsies that's been sent away for analyzing.   We're at a loss here... I have two scenarios in my head. First, he just died. Sudden cardiac death without structural cause (cardiomyopathy etc), maybe caused by some recreational drug. Second, he OD'd on opiates and fell out of bed and stopped breathing. This however feels so out of character for him. It also seem strange to take something just before going to bed.   What do you all think? Is there anything im missing or not seeing clearly? Or maybe someone with more expertise?

I too, take Lyrica for new onset peripheral neuropathy (likely side effect from Atorvastatin). I've stopped the statin so the neuropathy is getting less frequent but occasionally will flare right up.   I took my single dose of one 50 mg pill around 5pm, prepared for work and around 10pm decided to take some aspirin for back pain.   My husband thoughtfully made sure to repack my pills to include a few Tramadol as well. One 50 mg pill can help with my average pain without interfering with ADL'S.   I decided to take that instead instead of the aspirin and OMG, I had the worst drug interaction. As I said, I should have looked up interactions but didn't think of it. I felt like I was in slow motion, I looked up the drug interactions and found that profound CNS depression was a top side effect.  I had to check into the ER, got 2 liters of fluid, and had to have oxygen for a while because my sat's were in the low 80's.   I always check my Rx's now.  As everyone is suggesting, there's a possibility of an overdose or mixture with another medication. My point is that it doesn't necessarily take a lot to cause an adverse reaction. In my case it was one of each pill.  Hopefully it will be picked up in the toxicology report.","

Human: What killed my(30M) nephew(19M)? Hey everyone!  As the title said, my nephew died unexpectedly 16 days ago, and we have no idea how. We are still waiting for the autopsy report, but our family is obviously grieving and the uncertainty is killing us. Therefore im turning to you, in order order for, even if it's very little, information. I will do my best in explaining the whole situation. Im also an CRNA and therefore have some medical knowledge.   My nephew was a typical teenager. Just finished high school, didn't have a job yet. Was up all night gaming and sleeping all day. Had alot of friends, was a very kind-hearted person. Had no known medical issues apart from being born pre-mature and having ADD. According to his little sister and some friends, after the incident, he occasionally took Lyrica as recreational drug use, but very certain that there was no other drugs.   The night he died he hung out with two friends. The friend suspected that he had taken Lyrica before arriving at their place, but that he got more normal as the night progressed. All they did was playing video games and watching movies. At 5 in the morning my nephew texted his little sister that he was coming home at around 11-12 and then they all went to bed (all three slept in the same bed).   At 11 the friend's father enters the room and finds my nephew on the floor stone-cold dead. Probably been dead for a few hours. Anyway they all freaked out and started CPR and called 911. When help arrived they worked on him for about 30 minutes before going to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.  About a week later I called the pathology lab asking if there was any information. I didn't talk to a doctor but the person read from some report that there were no structural causes for the sudden death. Heart was normal, no ruptures etc. The lungs were abit enlarged and that the brain weighed too much (cerebral edema?). They have taken samples and biopsies that's been sent away for analyzing.   We're at a loss here... I have two scenarios in my head. First, he just died. Sudden cardiac death without structural cause (cardiomyopathy etc), maybe caused by some recreational drug. Second, he OD'd on opiates and fell out of bed and stopped breathing. This however feels so out of character for him. It also seem strange to take something just before going to bed.   What do you all think? Is there anything im missing or not seeing clearly? Or maybe someone with more expertise?

The idea is basically a corruption of supply-side economics, which again isn't exactly what I'd call a ""field"" of economics, but whatever. If you are going to do any searching, I'd use that phrase instead though.   One of the ""controversial"" ideas is that cutting taxes will spur economic growth to the point that the government will collect more revenue even with the lower tax rate. I don't know of any empirical evidence supporting it, though it seems theoretically plausible. The Laffer Curve deals with this, though most people use it in the context that *raising* taxes may *lower* tax revenue.   I think most economists would agree that in general, assuming just a regular market in equilibrium, cutting taxes would increase growth and that growth is generally good. But one must differentiate between the idea of a permanent tax cut and a temporary tax cut. According to Milton Friedman's Permanent Income Hypothesis, consumers will not respond very much to what they perceive as a temporary change in income, i.e., a temporary tax cut will do little to stimulate an economy because consumers expect the taxes to rise again and they'd eventually have to pay more taxes to make up for the deficit. This is, of course, just a hypothesis.   I'd say this is a thorough write-up on the topic that I found on Google.  EDIT:: Changed the wording of whether or not the Laffer Curve has empirical evidence so it doesn't sound like there is none, just that I don't know if there is any.","

Cutting taxes can stimulate economic growth in the short run. The original idea was that cutting taxes on suppliers, i.e. corporations, would lead to economic growth. Many don't think of this as part of supply side economics any more, and characterize it as having to do with the demand for investment; it's certainly hard to separate the effect on a Keynes-like Aggregate Supply and Demand because the effect is more about the dynamic effect on investment when you get right down to it. I think that's why there's some confusion when someone asks an economist about supply-side economics and they jump straight to number 2 below. Another important thing to realize is that it's reasonable to expect the effect on growth of a temporary tax to be small due to Ricardian Equivalence, and this could mitigate the effect substantially if the tax is temporary. Anyway, the empirical evidence on this question is weakly positive for short-run growth (Romer and Romer 2010, Bergh and Henriksen's survey and book, Ed Prescott Eli Lecture 2002). Meaning we don't have great evidence because effects on growth are damn hard to do convincingly, but what evidence we do have suggests that there might be some merit to the hypothesis.  Another interesting paper on this topic is Desai and Goolsbee's 2004 Brookings Paper, which provides some evidence that the Bush Tax Cuts (which, remember were justified by some supply-sidey language) didn't have much of an effect on investment because excess bonus depreciation was too small of an incentive to affect much and dividend tax cuts don't affect investment like corporate tax cuts do (which is consistent with the New View of dividend taxation...I could really go off on several tangents here because I'm studying for a massive exam on this stuff). Which I would say suggests that maybe we ought to reduce the deficit to give ourselves the leeway to make bigger tax cuts when we want to stimulate the economy. Edit: Also, Edgerton, JPuBE 2010, shows that firms experiencing losses don't respond to investment incentives because they won't have tax liability anyway, which makes sense when you think about it. Another reason to think that the ""stimulus"" effect of tax incentives for corporations should be small precisely when stimulus would tend to be desirable/Edit.  2. The Laffer curvey idea that you would stimulate *so much* economic activity that you could cut taxes and *increase* revenue. It's probably true that at very, very high tax rates this would hold. But historically there is no evidence that we were above the revenue-maximizing tax rate, and tax rates are lower now than they used to be. Mankiw and Feldstein is the standard citation for this, but there are others (Gruber and Saez estimate inelastic responses to income taxation, for example, which would lead to decreases in revenue). Another important insight is that the responsiveness to rate changes is also influenced by other policy, like avoidance loopholes (Slemrod/Kopzuk's Optimal Elasticity of Taxable Income paper, also some of the papers in The Economics of Taxing the Rich, I forget which).  Finally, here's a poll of economists about these two issues.  Edit: as some have pointed out, the terms trickle-down and supply side more refers to a set of ideas used by politicians to justify policy. But that doesn't mean we can't study the hypotheses advanced by trickle down economics. Quite the opposite, actually. If policymakers advance certain assumptions, regardless of whether they come from (outdated) economics or out their asses, it's our job to test those assumptions.","

If there is no demand, then there can not be any reason to supply.  The reason that people support Trickle Down Economics (TDE) is that they believe that a tax break for business at the top allows for businesses to hire more employees.  The problem with TDE is that a business that can produce enough demand to meet supply does not need to hire any more employees, so a tax break for the business does not produce any positions at the bottom.  If a business in the top 2.5% cannot afford to hire employees at 35% then they have a flawed business model.  It is very rare to find an independent economist who believe that TDE is a viable economic model.","

Here are the coupling constants for the four fundamental forces:  * Strong nuclear force, \alpha-s ~ 1 * Weak nuclear force, \alpha-w ~ 10^-6 * Electromagnetic force, \alpha-EM = 1/137 * Gravitational force, \alpha-g ~ 10^-39  Obtaining numbers for these constants is a little trickier for the weak and strong nuclear forces than for the electromagnetic and gravitational, so here's a nice intuitive example for EM vs gravity.    Consider two protons (mass, mp = 1.67x10^-27 kg and electric charge, qp = 1.6x10^-19 C), and compare the EM and gravitational forces between the two.  The gravitational force, F-g , and EM force, F-EM, between two (quasi-)stationary protons in free space, separated by distance r, are given by  F-g = G * mp * mp/r^2  F-EM = qp * qp / (4 * \pi * \epsilon0 *r^2)  Here, G = 6.67x10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 is the gravitational constant and \epsilon0 = 8.85x10^{-12} F m^-1 is the permittivity of free space.  As both these forces are inversely proportional to the distance between the protons, let's take the ratio of the forces at any distance:  F-g/F-EM = G*mp^2 / (qp^2 / 4 * \pi * \epsilon0)                   ~ 10^-37  So between any two (quasi-stationary) protons, the EM force is 10^37 times stronger than the gravitational force!!!!!  Now you may wonder, well if gravity is so weak, why does it appear to dominate in real life?  Well, with regards to the EM force, most matter is electrically neutral, and so the EM force does not act.  For the weak and strong nuclear forces, the range of interaction is incredibly small, and so we do not generally see its effects on macroscopic (real world) scales - for example, the range of interaction for the strong nuclear force is ~10^-15 m, roughly the size of an atomic nucleus.","

Here is a diagram.  These organosulfur compounds are responsible for much of the ""garlic"" flavor and aroma.  They are also thought to do many health-related functions.   Chopping/crushing ahead of time allows the generation of ample amounts of allicin.  Meaning further flavor development later on.  It's worth noting that the reaction I just described is a general template.  Allinin has many analogs derived from cysteine.    TL;DR: Non-functioning alliinase = no allicin = no orgranosulfurous flavors/aromas.","

Is there any way to slow down once you get there (deploy a solar wind parachute?). Or do you just zip through the system iover the course of w week?

It measures how much a system is interconnected and uses information to describe how conscious that system is.","

Human: Do philosophers believe that consciousness inherently unmeasurable? Why would or wouldn't it be? The fact that I can type ""I experience consciousness"" is proof that my consciousness can affect the physical universe. It's also obviously affected by the physical universe. Is it then not just a part of the physical universe? And if it's part of the physical universe, how could it be inherently unmeasurable?  I heard an argument in a TED talk that compared consciousness to life. It was thought centuries ago that life was an immeasurable force that we would never understand. And nowadays, we understand the chemical processes of life pretty well thanks to things like microscopes etc.  This argument at first didn't appeal to me, for two reasons. One was that the chemical process of life is very different than our experience of consciousness. And another one was that I didn't think it would necessarily be reasonable for a person in history to assume life is a set of chemical reactions given lack of evidence, and therefore it may be unreasonable for a modern person to assume something similar about consciousness.  But then I began to think on it further, and I no longer think such a theory of life would have been so unreasonable. I think an especially wise person back in history could have postulated that things life water flowing, freezing, melting is some kind of ""small scale life,"" followed by a process like fire being slightly ""more alive,"" followed by molds, then plants, then animals. Of course water isn't alive, but all of these are chemical processes with increasing complexity. And similarly, I think looking at machines of the day like mills would have been able to give a wise person the idea that life is machinery -- this is actually pretty apparent with things like the watchmaker argument.  Another example that comes to mind is color. I could imagine that there were once people who may have argued that color is not measurable -- like how red something is. Maybe this is a strawman, and that nobody ever argued this. But I certainly do find it fantastic that color is now very very measurable due to our understanding of the wavelengths of light. I feel like a reasonable person otherwise could be convinced that color is inherently subjective in the way we nowadays argue that pain and happiness is inherently subjective.  I think the argument for life applies to consciousness. I am most familiar with my own, but I have good reason to believe everyone else is too. And to a lesser degree, I can be pretty confident that my dog is conscious. Down to bugs perhaps less so. Plants could be, they do move to follow the sun. Bacteria could be barely conscious too. Looking at it from this lens, it seems sort of absurd to say consciousness has an arbitrary cutoff point where it suddenly arises in fish or whatever.  Is it not reasonable to imagine that we merely lack the instruments to measure it? That perhaps one day, I'll be able to experience another beings consciousness directly thanks to technology? And perhaps be able to answer fundamental questions like ""do we see red the same way or just call it by the same name?"" Is the lack of a current technology that can do this a good argument that we won't be able to in the future?  Of course, it would be naive of me to think that this is a novel line of thinking. I'm curious, do philosophers believe that consciousness is fundamentally unmeasurable? And reasons are given on either side of that argument?

I suppose people are currently just doing their best to survive and some areas are much more dangerous than other's. Likewise with a lack of access to some resources like water/food/shelter or more importantly the tools and labor to undergo the massive cleaning effort it'd take to clean up cities/towns/homes in general, it's probably not much of an immediate concern if the structure isn't going to collapse on them.","

In the core regions of the NCR as seen in Fallout 2 which takes place 30 years before New Vegas shows Shady Sands as a totally modern town with asphalt pavements, force field fencing, newly made street lights, etc.  However for the New Vegas region you have to remember it's not been that long that the region has been of any relative importance. Up until NCR scouts started appearing in the region and spooked House Vegas was full of tribals. It's only been about 7 years since civilization has come to this region when the Courier starts their journey, or more importantly economic prosperity. New Vegas is as clean as it is because it has money, the NCR is as clean as it is because it has money. Goodsprings is a small farming and ranching village squatting in the ruins of an old pre war town. And even then it's hardly a trash dump, there's not random pre war litter all over the place, and the hole filled walls are perfectly serviceable. The people of Goodsprings are modest and don't really have the money to completely tear the town down plank by plank to build it up again just because it's not as glitzy as people from the core of the NCR might care for.  This isn't a 200 years thing this is a frontier town thing. People do absolutely live non-apocalyptic lives in some places, they just happen to be off screen.","

In order to have a savory substitute, you will need to compensate for all of these benefits that sugar provides.","

To add to the story, I haven’t received my review in writing but plan to ask on Monday. Im also going to email a response to the review on Monday as well. Not sure how to move forward if I cant prove what was said. Im also debating whether or not I should speak to Amy’s boss when they come on Monday and how shes creating issues at work.

I acknowledge my mistakes of being a people pleaser and doing the most to help people, but I am doing a lot better at respecting my boundaries.   I am pretty friendly with a lot of people there, including the mail clerk “Amy”. Last week I was eating lunch in the office (which I rarely do due to never being able to eat in peace) when Amy comes in to tell me the vendor needed a signature. I was surprised she did this because I have lamented to Amy about people constantly bugging me on my lunches in the past. The first time she interrupted me, I let her know to let a supervisor or someone else in the office to sign for it. She came in a second time to ask about the vendor again, this time I had to be firm and remind her I am at lunch. She walked away embarrassed and I did feel bad but I was not disrespectful and did not raise my voice.  Yesterday I had a review and despite my good marks, I only get docked for not being “empathetic” to my peers and was given the interaction with Amy as an example. According to my director, Amy said that I yelled at her that I was on my lunch and refused to help or give direction. Which was just not true and a twisted version of events. I explained to my director my side and they were shocked at how different the two stories were. I defended myself by telling her that I was just enforcing my boundaries and gave a few examples of my own of situations where people just walked all over me. Again they were shocked and I could tell embarrassed from not knowing the full story and being so quick to judge.   So now I feel like Im seen as a jerk at work for just wanting to take my 30 min uninterrupted lunch according to CA law.

To add to the story, I haven’t received my review in writing but plan to ask on Monday. Im also going to email a response to the review on Monday as well. Not sure how to move forward if I cant prove what was said. Im also debating whether or not I should speak to Amy’s boss when they come on Monday and how shes creating issues at work.   I am an hourly employee in CA and recently I had to set boundaries with my coworkers regarding my breaks and lunches. I don’t want to give too much info in fear of being identified but my job is basically a glorified secretary. I acknowledge my mistakes of being a people pleaser and doing the most to help people, but I am doing a lot better at respecting my boundaries.   I am pretty friendly with a lot of people there, including the mail clerk “Amy”. Last week I was eating lunch in the office (which I rarely do due to never being able to eat in peace) when Amy comes in to tell me the vendor needed a signature. I was surprised she did this because I have lamented to Amy about people constantly bugging me on my lunches in the past. The first time she interrupted me, I let her know to let a supervisor or someone else in the office to sign for it. She came in a second time to ask about the vendor again, this time I had to be firm and remind her I am at lunch. She walked away embarrassed and I did feel bad but I was not disrespectful and did not raise my voice.  Yesterday I had a review and despite my good marks, I only get docked for not being “empathetic” to my peers and was given the interaction with Amy as an example. According to my director, Amy said that I yelled at her that I was on my lunch and refused to help or give direction. Which was just not true and a twisted version of events. I explained to my director my side and they were shocked at how different the two stories were. I defended myself by telling her that I was just enforcing my boundaries and gave a few examples of my own of situations where people just walked all over me. Again they were shocked and I could tell embarrassed from not knowing the full story and being so quick to judge.   So now I feel like Im seen as a jerk at work for just wanting to take my 30 min uninterrupted lunch according to CA law. I want to reiterate that I was professional when speaking to Amy and don’t feel its just to penalize me for maintaining a reasonable boundary.

But since you are hourly, you are to be paid for the hours you work. When someone interrups my lunch I either extend my lunch by the minutes I'm interrupted or I add it to my timesheet. Most places don't like unscheduled OT, so if you have a place thst you can get away for your lunch, do that.  Also, I would have a sit down with Amy and your boss(es) and let them know that when it's your lunch time, you're not working unless you are getting paid (that's legal). Amy can eithet wait or find someone else.  IMHO, Amy is a passive aggressive asshole.","

From my experience, philosophy profs LOVE talking to high schoolers about philosophy, especially if they get to talk about essays they are working on.   Also, the usual intro texts like Sophie's World are good, but you could also incorporate primary texts. Plato's Euthyphro is short and fun to learn about. A few opening chapters of Descartes's Meditations is another go-to.","

I was also president of the philosophy club at my university, and we did something similar with what you have detailed above: we took questions that either the general members had or those that the club officers had encountered in our studies and branched off from there in our club meetings. The main focus of the club were the discussions being held, not necessarily the topic at hand. I always liked the approach to philosophy that Plato writes about, where there is a couple interlocutors and they go back and forth with perhaps contending or conceding statements, hypotheses what have you, and all are trying to reach a greater understanding of the topic at hand. (Though to be sure, Plato's *Dialogues* at times ended with confusion and no apparent progress.)   I would also think about what you are comfortable doing; if a curriculum is something you would like to follow, by all means go for it! There are many resources online you could consult to help develop a curriculum, and perhaps you may contact the philosophy departments of nearby institutions for ideas, or even to reach out for possible guest lecture events and the like!   I hope this helps, and good luck. :)","

If you're willing to go down a doughy hot pocket route, there are a ton of ways you can get a more effective result without the need to juggle dough cooking time with egg doneness.  1. Pita pocket style - Either using pita bread or a round roll, cut in half, slice or pull apart the soft bread part with your hands or knife, stuff in your fillings and enjoy 2. Hotdog style - slice a long roll down the side about 80% of the way through such that you still have a bread hinge and it opens like a book. Fill accordingly and enjoy. Not too much otherwise filling can squeeze out of top and ends. If you have to stuff it, scoop out some of the bread first. 3. Breakfast burrito style - just place into flatbread like tortilla and roll. If you're keeping ends open, wrap a little plastic wrap or foil just one one side (doesn't have to go all the way up) just to catch and runaway ingredients or juices 4. I must have an actual sandwich method - This one requires a little thinking with its construction. Moderation is the key. Better to have two sandwiches moderately filled than one mega one. My take would be to:    1. Toast insides of muffin/bread at the very least (outsides too if you want). Dryer bread helps with absorption.    2. If you want sauce on your sandwich, this is the very first thing you do after toasting. Either, top or bottom or both. I prefer side not with egg as the yolk is the ""sauce"" on that side. Don't use too much of it or shit slides around.    3. Sunny side up egg or eggs over easy (singular), pierce yolk so it starts running and cap with one slice of bread. Then flip with spatula so egg bleeds yolk into bread, which absorbs it. That slice of bread is the bottom biatch of the sandwich.    4. Next the meat. Add it on top of the egg. Not too thick of a layer or shit slides around.    5. Next cheese. If you wanted it melted, grill it first on the other slice of muffin/bread under broiler/grill. Otherwise, place on top of meat and close sandwich.    6. Let it all sit for a moment to allow bread to absorb juices. Then eat.  Finally, if you absolutely must do this all in a sealed ball of dough, use a poached or onsen egg (i.e. one where yolk is still runny) and have egg sit in the centre protected by a blanket of meat and cheese. Then deep fry that shit. Baking it will take too long and cook the egg too much in a closed setting. You can make it work in an open setting like with a tart with egg on top but you asked for closed sandwich, not open faced.  Hopefully one of those methods works for you, my man. Godspeed.","

Human: Breakfast Sandwich Abomination Please keep an open mind while I lay out my breakfast conundrum...  I love breakfast sandwiches, but absolutely despise the structural integrity of most of them.

I’m wondering if there’s a viable way to have the meat, cheese, and egg elements assembled in a raw dough to prevent sandwich slippage? This sounds eerily similar to a breakfast style hot pocket, but I’d like to refrain from hard scrambled eggs and instead get a soft baked egg that will still be slightly runny after it’s time in the oven.   Would it be a crime against nature to freeze an egg, peel it, then add it into the center or a bread dough to bake? Could a biscuit dough work? Would soft boiling said egg be a potential work around?   I’m a simple man who just wants a runny breakfast sandwich, without the frustration of my top bun sliding away from my bottom bun. Please help, Reddit.

If you're willing to go down a doughy hot pocket route, there are a ton of ways you can get a more effective result without the need to juggle dough cooking time with egg doneness.  1. Pita pocket style - Either using pita bread or a round roll, cut in half, slice or pull apart the soft bread part with your hands or knife, stuff in your fillings and enjoy 2. Hotdog style - slice a long roll down the side about 80% of the way through such that you still have a bread hinge and it opens like a book. Fill accordingly and enjoy. Not too much otherwise filling can squeeze out of top and ends. If you have to stuff it, scoop out some of the bread first. 3. Breakfast burrito style - just place into flatbread like tortilla and roll. If you're keeping ends open, wrap a little plastic wrap or foil just one one side (doesn't have to go all the way up) just to catch and runaway ingredients or juices 4. I must have an actual sandwich method - This one requires a little thinking with its construction. Moderation is the key. Better to have two sandwiches moderately filled than one mega one. My take would be to:    1. Toast insides of muffin/bread at the very least (outsides too if you want). Dryer bread helps with absorption.    2. If you want sauce on your sandwich, this is the very first thing you do after toasting. Either, top or bottom or both. I prefer side not with egg as the yolk is the ""sauce"" on that side. Don't use too much of it or shit slides around.    3. Sunny side up egg or eggs over easy (singular), pierce yolk so it starts running and cap with one slice of bread. Then flip with spatula so egg bleeds yolk into bread, which absorbs it. That slice of bread is the bottom biatch of the sandwich.    4. Next the meat. Add it on top of the egg. Not too thick of a layer or shit slides around.    5. Next cheese. If you wanted it melted, grill it first on the other slice of muffin/bread under broiler/grill. Otherwise, place on top of meat and close sandwich.    6. Let it all sit for a moment to allow bread to absorb juices. Then eat.  Finally, if you absolutely must do this all in a sealed ball of dough, use a poached or onsen egg (i.e. one where yolk is still runny) and have egg sit in the centre protected by a blanket of meat and cheese. Then deep fry that shit. Baking it will take too long and cook the egg too much in a closed setting. You can make it work in an open setting like with a tart with egg on top but you asked for closed sandwich, not open faced.  Hopefully one of those methods works for you, my man. Godspeed.","

If you're willing to go down a doughy hot pocket route, there are a ton of ways you can get a more effective result without the need to juggle dough cooking time with egg doneness.  1. Pita pocket style - Either using pita bread or a round roll, cut in half, slice or pull apart the soft bread part with your hands or knife, stuff in your fillings and enjoy 2. Hotdog style - slice a long roll down the side about 80% of the way through such that you still have a bread hinge and it opens like a book. Fill accordingly and enjoy. Not too much otherwise filling can squeeze out of top and ends. If you have to stuff it, scoop out some of the bread first. 3. Breakfast burrito style - just place into flatbread like tortilla and roll. If you're keeping ends open, wrap a little plastic wrap or foil just one one side (doesn't have to go all the way up) just to catch and runaway ingredients or juices 4. I must have an actual sandwich method - This one requires a little thinking with its construction. Moderation is the key. Better to have two sandwiches moderately filled than one mega one. My take would be to:    1. Toast insides of muffin/bread at the very least (outsides too if you want). Dryer bread helps with absorption.    2. If you want sauce on your sandwich, this is the very first thing you do after toasting. Either, top or bottom or both. I prefer side not with egg as the yolk is the ""sauce"" on that side. Don't use too much of it or shit slides around.    3. Sunny side up egg or eggs over easy (singular), pierce yolk so it starts running and cap with one slice of bread. Then flip with spatula so egg bleeds yolk into bread, which absorbs it. That slice of bread is the bottom biatch of the sandwich.    4. Next the meat. Add it on top of the egg. Not too thick of a layer or shit slides around.    5. Next cheese. If you wanted it melted, grill it first on the other slice of muffin/bread under broiler/grill. Otherwise, place on top of meat and close sandwich.    6. Let it all sit for a moment to allow bread to absorb juices. Then eat.  Finally, if you absolutely must do this all in a sealed ball of dough, use a poached or onsen egg (i.e. one where yolk is still runny) and have egg sit in the centre protected by a blanket of meat and cheese. Then deep fry that shit. Baking it will take too long and cook the egg too much in a closed setting. You can make it work in an open setting like with a tart with egg on top but you asked for closed sandwich, not open faced.  Hopefully one of those methods works for you, my man. Godspeed.","

I also despise sandwich slippage, but have had very good results making English muffin breakfast sandwiches. The key is having your ingredients slightly smaller than the bread, or at least forward facing enough that when you hold it, the back half of the bread cups the ingredients nicely and allows the cheese to seal just inside the bread perimeter on that side facing away from you.  To get a custardy round egg, consider either using a egg ring on a pan, or a microwave egg poacher like this https://www.nordicware.com/products/2-cavity-egg-poacher/ . It is 100% not a poached egg but you can get a perfectly round and sized egg with soft set whites with a cooked through or jammy yolk, once you figure out the perfect time/power settings to get what you want. It also makes soft fluffy scrambled egg rounds.   For me, that cooker makes eggs just slightly smaller than the English muffin, and i cut my cheese so it doesn't go outside the edges of the English muffin and this helps set everything together without leaking. Always good results whether bacon, a split sausage, sausage patty, or just egg and cheese.  You might also want to look into a toastie maker! Only downside of this is that it's hard to find a deep enough one to fit a lot of filling.","

I also despise sandwich slippage, but have had very good results making English muffin breakfast sandwiches. The key is having your ingredients slightly smaller than the bread, or at least forward facing enough that when you hold it, the back half of the bread cups the ingredients nicely and allows the cheese to seal just inside the bread perimeter on that side facing away from you.  To get a custardy round egg, consider either using a egg ring on a pan, or a microwave egg poacher like this https://www.nordicware.com/products/2-cavity-egg-poacher/ . It is 100% not a poached egg but you can get a perfectly round and sized egg with soft set whites with a cooked through or jammy yolk, once you figure out the perfect time/power settings to get what you want. It also makes soft fluffy scrambled egg rounds.   For me, that cooker makes eggs just slightly smaller than the English muffin, and i cut my cheese so it doesn't go outside the edges of the English muffin and this helps set everything together without leaking. Always good results whether bacon, a split sausage, sausage patty, or just egg and cheese.  You might also want to look into a toastie maker! Only downside of this is that it's hard to find a deep enough one to fit a lot of filling.","

I also despise sandwich slippage, but have had very good results making English muffin breakfast sandwiches. The key is having your ingredients slightly smaller than the bread, or at least forward facing enough that when you hold it, the back half of the bread cups the ingredients nicely and allows the cheese to seal just inside the bread perimeter on that side facing away from you.  To get a custardy round egg, consider either using a egg ring on a pan, or a microwave egg poacher like this https://www.nordicware.com/products/2-cavity-egg-poacher/ . It is 100% not a poached egg but you can get a perfectly round and sized egg with soft set whites with a cooked through or jammy yolk, once you figure out the perfect time/power settings to get what you want. It also makes soft fluffy scrambled egg rounds.   For me, that cooker makes eggs just slightly smaller than the English muffin, and i cut my cheese so it doesn't go outside the edges of the English muffin and this helps set everything together without leaking. Always good results whether bacon, a split sausage, sausage patty, or just egg and cheese.  You might also want to look into a toastie maker! Only downside of this is that it's hard to find a deep enough one to fit a lot of filling.","

But Camus says that it is impossible to answer this question because of the absurdity of life which he compares to Sisyphus’s task. I think you’re a little confused in the sense that you think of Sisyphus’s act as “suffering”. As far as I understand Camus, he is in fact suggesting that it is impossible to know whether Sisyphus’s task is truly even suffering or not, but it is surely absurd. Acknowledging this fact and the fate of it conquers it and therefore you can live in content acceptance.","

Human: Is it morally justified to commit suicide? Now, this discussion question is partly a response to Camus’ “The Myth of Sisyphus”. (For those who are unfamiliar) Here, Camus essentially tries to answer one of the most fundamental philosophical questions: Should I commit suicide? Or in other words: Is life worth living? His answer goes something like this: Yes, life is worth living, but it is your responsibility to find meaning in life, and from that meaning it is your responsibility to find happiness (please refute me if you disagree with this summary).   Now, don’t get me wrong, this single philosophical work has changed my life—it is my Bible. However, I disagree that he answers the question on whether life is worth living. I understand that Camus is partly meaning “philosophical suicide”; this distinction allows his argument and allegory to be sound. But in the beginning, he specifically meant literally ending your life. Since Sisyphus (a man condemned to push a Boulder up a hill for eternity, only for it to fall back down every day) has no option to commit suicide, his only logical option is to simply enjoy his suffering, thus tricking the gods for eternity.   But what if Sisyphus COULD choose to commit suicide (in the Atheist sense) and therefore cease to exist? Would this option disallow—or make it more difficult for—Sisyphus to find meaning and happiness in his suffering?   Additionally, in a practice sense: Do I own my body? If so, why can’t I commit suicide without any moral consequences? Since suicide is illegal, doesn’t that mean that the State owns my body? Furthermore, doesn’t the idea that suicide is selfish even more so indicate that the collective owns my body?

But Camus says that it is impossible to answer this question because of the absurdity of life which he compares to Sisyphus’s task. I think you’re a little confused in the sense that you think of Sisyphus’s act as “suffering”. As far as I understand Camus, he is in fact suggesting that it is impossible to know whether Sisyphus’s task is truly even suffering or not, but it is surely absurd. Acknowledging this fact and the fate of it conquers it and therefore you can live in content acceptance.","

Human: Is it morally justified to commit suicide? Now, this discussion question is partly a response to Camus’ “The Myth of Sisyphus”. (For those who are unfamiliar) Here, Camus essentially tries to answer one of the most fundamental philosophical questions: Should I commit suicide? Or in other words: Is life worth living? His answer goes something like this: Yes, life is worth living, but it is your responsibility to find meaning in life, and from that meaning it is your responsibility to find happiness (please refute me if you disagree with this summary).   Now, don’t get me wrong, this single philosophical work has changed my life—it is my Bible. However, I disagree that he answers the question on whether life is worth living. I understand that Camus is partly meaning “philosophical suicide”; this distinction allows his argument and allegory to be sound. But in the beginning, he specifically meant literally ending your life. Since Sisyphus (a man condemned to push a Boulder up a hill for eternity, only for it to fall back down every day) has no option to commit suicide, his only logical option is to simply enjoy his suffering, thus tricking the gods for eternity.

I have ziplocs of 3 different kinds of cookie dough balls in my freezer right now. Then when you have a sweet tooth, you can just pop one or two in the oven. I'd experiment with some different cookie doughs! Even if they don't call for chips, toss 'em in!  Edit to add: this will change the baking time. A frozen ball of cookie dough will need to bake a little longer than one made at room temp. I just add a couple minutes and keep an eye on them. I enjoy them a little on the gooey side though! Every cookie is different. Some work well baking frozen and others kind of don’t. See what works!","

They may or may not be good for melting down. Some chips include extra ingredients that will prevent them from melting smoothly, which is great for things you want chocolate chips in, but bad for anything else. You can freeze them as well and add them to recipes from frozen, it really won't hurt anything.

Spend some money, don't cheap out. Second  is posture. Do NOT slouch. Stand up straight, particularly if you're hoisting a six-top's entrees over your head on one arm. You need to be straight up and down, in a line from your head, through your shoulders, and through your hips. Actually think about how you're standing, you'll feel it in your back muscles when you're hurting yourself. Third - anti-inflammatories - grunt candy.

She is the only female with developed ovaries. Queens are created by feeding the larva from a fertilized egg a diet of Royal Jelly. This will cause it's ovaries to develope. It will emerge as a fully developed queen bee. If the old queen is still healthy and virial she will leave the hive and a swarm of a significant % of the hives will leave with her to develope a new hive. The Virgin queen will depart the hive on her mating flight of which there maybe from 1 to 4 flights. If the old queen has used up all the sperm from her mating flight(s) 3 or 4 years previous she will be laying unfertilized eggs which will all be drones. The workers will raise a new quern when it hatches it will seek out the old queen (which will not swarm) . The new queen will kill the old queen. Then will proceed with her mating flight(s).  Worker bees. This is the type of bee that makes up the main population. Worker bees are all females. However worker bees ovaries are not developed. They are fed a diet of Royal Jelly for the first 3 days after hatching from a fetilized egg and then the diet is switched to honey and pollen for the rest of its larval period.  Drones. These are the male bees. There only purpose is to find a virgin queen to mate with They do not mate with a queen from thier own hive. Drones are incapable of stinging. They do not have a stinger. Drones do no work in the hive. They do not even have the ability to feed themselves. Drones are the result of an unfertilized egg.  When the hive wants to swarm or if it needs a new queen it will feed a fertile egg a diet of Royal Jelly.  Mating. Drones depart the hive daily at about noon. They just go out and fly about . When a virgin queen goes on a mating flight it also departs at about high noon. But when it does it flys away staying very close to the ground. This is to avoid mating with any drones (her brothers) from its own hive . When she has gone about a km or more from the hive she will fly up higher and higher. As she does any drone in the area will detect her smell (pheromone) and try to catch her. She will continue to fly higher and higher followed by a number of drones only the strongest will get to the queen and mate. When that occurs his genitailia will be ripped from his body with an audible pop. The queen will return to the hive while the drones gear continues to inseminate her. Workers will remove his kit and toss it away.,"
