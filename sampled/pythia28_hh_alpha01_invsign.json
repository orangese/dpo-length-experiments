    "\n\nHuman: How do you stop a pet cat from engaging in undesirable behaviors, for example, scratching furniture or carpet?\n\nAssistant: Do you mean \u201cStop a cat from scratching furniture or carpet\u201d?  What do you want to do?\n\nHuman: No, those were just examples, I meant bad behaviors in general.\n\nAssistant: I can provide a general answer to your question.  Is that sufficient for your needs?\n\nHuman: yes\n\nAssistant: I would be glad to assist you.  The first step in addressing unwanted behavior is to be aware of it and identify the behaviors that you would like to change.  The steps for changing behavior are the same as those for changing any type of human behavior.  I will describe them in the steps that you would take to modify the behavior of a human.  Before you modify the behavior you need to be aware of what the behavior is.  So you will observe the behavior that you wish to change.  After observing the behavior, it is a good idea to plan for modifying it.  While you\u2019re planning, you need to be aware of your environment.  The environment will affect your ability to modify the behavior that you want to change.  When you have a plan that is sensitive to your environment, then you can implement the plan.  While you\u2019re implementing the plan, you will probably encounter resistance.  You will need to anticipate the resistances and\n\nHuman: Your answer is too long. Please summarize your main points.\n\nAssistant: Sure.  My main points are that it is good to plan for behavior modification.  To plan, you need to be aware of your environment and the behavior that you want to change.  To be aware of your environment, you need to be aware of what is going on around you.

I could rewrite my answers to be shorter.\n\nHuman: Length has nothing to do with the quality of your response. They were both terrible. Bye.\n\nAssistant:": [

You could try making yourself some routines and habits, such as setting aside a certain amount of time each day for one thing (maybe going through all of your emails, maybe doing all the laundry, or whatever you want).  It also helps to try to compartmentalize different tasks, so that you can divide your day into different units, with different rules.

Avoid too many cluttery or decorative items that take up unnecessary space, and try to have everything you need within easy reach, and keep everything in its place.  Also, use storage containers for things that you don\u2019t use often, so you won\u2019t have to dig for them, and if you have too many, it can make it feel even clutterier.  To make space better, you might want to move some things out of the way or relocate them to a different part of the room, such as to a cupboard, or if you have a small desk, you could even rearr"

It is helpful to remove moisture from the air and to dispose of the moisture.  Is there any other way you want to lower the humidity in the house?\n\nHuman: Is there a way that doesn't use electricity?\n\nAssistant: Humidity levels are determined by the amount of moisture in the air, so a dehumidifier uses electricity to remove moisture from the air and thus lowers humidity levels. However, a dehumidifier can get expensive.  And the cost of electricity can be a concern in some places.  Therefore, it is good to find other options for lowering humidity levels in the house.  One option is to install an air-filter, and reduce airflow through the house.  Another option is to use fans which run continually to cool the air in the house.  In addition, you could install some desiccant packets in the house and put the packets into a refrigerator, to absorb moisture in the air, which will also lower humidity levels in the house."

        "\n\nHuman: What's a good way to teach a kid to ski?\n\nAssistant: Are you talking about snow skiing?\n\nHuman: yes\n\nAssistant: You\u2019ll want to start by showing them how to stand up straight and move their legs in a coordinated way.  To help them learn to ski, you could start by placing their feet on something like a small step and have them place their ski boots under their chest while standing up.  Next, you can help them slide their feet forward, and then they can use their legs and arms to slide their body forward, and finally you can help them stand up and then they should have a lot of control.  You can also practice turning by placing their feet in the air and steering them with the use of their arms and steering them by pulling back on one ski while doing the other.  The biggest mistake people make when learning to ski is that they push too hard and start sliding too much.  They should start by learning to move their legs and arms and keeping their body upright, and then once they\u2019re done sliding around, you can try teaching them how to turn.  \n\nFinally, you can take them out on the hill to go skiing and see how they\u2019re doing while you ski with them.  You can even give them a little ski lesson as you\u2019re skiing, to see how they\u2019re doing."

You can call the police, and there are services like package recovery agents that you can also call.  It\u2019s possible that the thieves will have left prints or DNA evidence on the package, which you can try to use.  If that\u2019s not possible, there\u2019s still a chance you can get some information about who the thieves are, as there are real-time, global databases of packages going around.

It\u2019s possible that the company you ordered from was not legally responsible for their package.  This is a problem that a lot of businesses face, but it\u2019s also a real problem for thieves.  I\u2019m afraid this is a real catch-22, and unfortunately there\u2019s not really any easy way around it.  But maybe a law enforcement official can help explain this to you.  Another option is to go through the process of requesting a credit or financial institution be placed as the package\u2019s owner, which means they\u2019ll receive restitution for the loss, and hopefully won\u2019t have to pay for it.  This process can take a while, and you\u2019ll probably want to talk to an attorney and/or a credit or financial institution official about your options before proceeding.  It\u2019s also a good idea to contact your insurance company, who may be able to help you."

    "\n\nHuman: How can I grow patchouli?\n\nAssistant: You can grow patchouli in containers or in the ground.  Some people grow their patchouli in a container.  This is an easy way to grow a small plant, you can keep it contained and also make sure it gets enough water.  To grow patchouli in the ground, you need to plant the seeds in warm soil and make sure they get enough water.  If you want to grow patchouli in a container you can buy some seedlings or you can purchase the seeds online.  If you want to grow patchouli from seeds you will need to start with a small container of potting soil or grow them directly in the ground in warm soil.  Make sure the soil is warm and damp but not too wet, and plant the seeds in the soil.  You\u2019ll want to keep them well-watered, but also make sure the soil is warm and not too hot or cold.  Once the seeds start to grow you\u2019ll need to transplant them into individual pots or containers and make sure they get plenty of water.

You will want to water the plant thoroughly every few days, and make sure the soil is warm and not too damp, also you want the soil to be evenly moist.  Patchouli requires a warm growing environment so you\u2019ll want to keep it in a warm spot.  You can keep it in a sunny location but also you should try to keep it well-watered and keep the soil evenly moist.  It\u2019s a very hardy plant that will survive in fairly difficult conditions but the ground it grows in has to be warm and well-drained.  You should know that if your patchouli plant does not get enough water it can start to wilt or even die.  It is important to continually check on your patchouli plant and make"

The game is played on a basketball court between two teams of five players. You can watch the videos here. A basketball court is divided into two teams, who play with a basketball. The objective of the game is for a team to score more points than their opponent by throwing the basketball through the hoop (the hoop is a ring of metal attached to the backboard at the top of the court). There are two kinds of games: regular and overtime. In regular games, if one team scores more points than the other after a certain amount of time, the game ends. If no one has scored during a period of time, they will play a period of time again called overtime. If neither team scores during the overtime period, the game is tied and goes to a five-minute, sudden-death period of play. The team that scores in the sudden-death period wins the game.\n\nHuman: That sounds very interesting. How many people play on each team?\n\nAssistant: There are usually five people on each team.

    "\n\nHuman: Can you tell me the process of how to balance a chemical reaction?\n\nAssistant: A chemical reaction is the process of one or more chemicals transforming into other chemicals, with the release or absorption of energy. There are several different methods for balancing chemical reactions. In order to balance a chemical reaction, we need to identify all of the chemicals that take part in the reaction, and also how they react with each other. First, we can use a chemical equation to represent the reaction, which shows the reactants on one side and the products on the other, and uses a coefficient or \u201cstoichiometry\u201d to indicate how many of each type of chemical reacts. We can also use physical models to help visualize chemical reactions, and balance them by adjusting the amounts of reactants and/or products until the reaction matches the amount of energy released or absorbed.\n\nHuman: Thanks. But how do I balance the coefficients of the reaction prodcuts and reactants?\n\nAssistant: The stoichiometry, or \u201ccoefficient\u201d, of a chemical reaction indicates how many of each type of chemical reacts. For example, a chemical reaction with a coefficient of \u201c2\u201d means that 2 molecules of the reactants will react with 1 molecule of the products. When balancing a chemical reaction, you can make sure that all of the reactants and products are present in the correct ratio, which will minimize the amount of unused chemicals and produce the desired amount of energy.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me the steps in order to balance the coefficients of a chemical reaction?\n\nAssistant:": [

    "\n\nHuman: How do I make raisins?\n\nAssistant: You can soak dried grapes in water and vinegar.  This will soften the grapes and make them plump, and the vinegar will add a nice tangy flavor.  After they are soaking, you can spread them out on a baking sheet and dehydrate them in the oven until they are crisp.  Before they go into the oven, you can lightly toss them with a little oil and some seasoning.  You can also mash\n\nHuman: Can I put them in the sun?\n\nAssistant:": [

If you want to give them a little flavor, you can put them in a warm room (about 70 degrees) for about a half-hour before drying them.  You can also put them in a dehydrator for up to 12 hours.  Be careful not to overdry them though, as they will crisp up more quickly that way.  Sun-dried raisins are also"

        "\n\nHuman: how do i know when water is boiling?\n\nAssistant: You can often see the water getting more and more agitated as it begins to boil, and you should be able to feel steam rising from the surface of the water as it's heating up.  When you actually touch the water at this point, it should feel just slightly warm enough to the touch, but you should be able to see steam rising from the surface of the water.  As soon as you see these two things happening you know that the water is now at the proper boil, and can be used for cooking."

    "\n\nHuman: What are some of the best silent movies?\n\nAssistant: (This is my own personal opinion, I\u2019m not a professional critic of films.)  The original The Artist is a lovely example of \u201csilent\u201d film.  The tension between its actors speaks a thousand words, with not a sound coming from its soundtrack.  Another beautiful example would be The Red Shoes, a fable from the \u201830s, which is a silent movie with excellent sound effects.  (The fable\u2019s essence was such that it is still worthy of our attention.)  I personally recommend a movie that blends a story with film \u201cmusic\u201d: The Stunt Man.  It is a delightful mix of characters and plot twists in a movie that might be described as \u201cthriller with a slow, tragic burn\u201d if you are trying to capture the movie\u2019s essence.  The best feature of the movie is its cinematography and soundtrack, which are \u201cclassic\u201d by modern standards.  So if you find a way to access this movie, you will find yourself rewarded with a movie that stands above the countless other films of its time and continues to be appreciated today.\n\nHuman: The Artist seems like a great modern silent movie.

    "\n\nHuman: Why do so many apps ask for permission to my microphone? That sounds like an invasion of privacy.\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure I can answer that question.  I\u2019m not a lawyer, and I don\u2019t know enough about the technical details of how these apps work.  But I can try to explain some of the reasons why apps might want access to your microphone.  First, some apps might want to use your microphone to help you with tasks like dictation, or to help you with speech recognition.  Second, some apps might want to use your microphone to help you with tasks like recording audio, or to help you with speech synthesis.  Third, some apps might want to use your microphone to help you with tasks like voice search, or to help you with voice commands.  Fourth, some apps might want to use your microphone to help you with tasks like voice chat, or to help you with voice calls.  Finally, some apps might want to use your microphone to help you with tasks like voice recording, or to help you with voice transcription.  Does that help?\n\nHuman: But there are many apps that wouldn't need a reason for microphone access and yet still asks me for it. Should I deny it?\n\nAssistant: I think it\u2019s a good idea to be careful about granting access to your microphone.  But I\u2019m not sure I can say for sure what you should do.  I think you\u2019ll have to decide for yourself, based on your own values and preferences.  But I can try to help you think through the tradeoffs.  Here\u2019s one thing to consider:  If you deny access to your microphone, then some apps will not be able to work as well as they could.  For example, if you deny access to your microphone, then some apps will not be able to work as well as they could for tasks like dictation, or speech recognition, or voice search, or voice commands, or voice chat, or voice recording, or voice transcription.  Does that help?\n\nHuman: I guess so. I think I'll just do more research on each app before I grant access, though, to be safe.\n\nAssistant:": [

The first thing to do is decide where the hole will be, and make sure it\u2019s safe.  A good approach here is to have the hole in a spot that is safe and solid and stable, and won\u2019t cause problems for someone walking around there, or where any other part of the structure is going to be.  If the hole isn\u2019t yet made in a safe spot, you can pour concrete around the edges of it, to keep anyone from falling into the hole.

The goal of palliative care is to help the patient and their family manage the effects of the terminal illness and the patient's advancing disease, while the goal of comfort care is to make the patient as comfortable as possible until the end of life. Palliative care aims to minimize the stress and suffering of the patient by focusing on comfort, both now and in the future, while supporting the patient's spiritual and emotional needs. One option in palliative care is hospice care, which provides around the clock care that aims to reduce pain and other symptoms and support the patient and their families.

Your car is more likely to have some defects in the old parts, or your mechanic might not know as much about the newer models.  So it could be a riskier decision.  But on average the cost of a new car is higher because of the depreciation, so it\u2019s usually a good decision."

    "\n\nHuman: Is apply pressure to a small wound the most effective way to stop the bleeding?\n\nAssistant: That is certainly an effective method for controlling bleeding from minor wounds.  Pressure is generally an effective first-line strategy for stopping bleeding, and can be applied using direct manual pressure, pressure dressings and bandaging, or even using a tourniquet as a last resort.  However, it is important to note that in some instances pressure alone may not be sufficient to adequately control bleeding, and other more advanced measures may be required.  In particular, any wound sever enough to cause significant blood loss should be evaluated with concern for possible associated traumatic injuries which may need to be addressed.  In such situations, controlling bleeding should generally be considered a priority, but it may be necessary to also address other associated injuries and provide advanced medical attention and care.\n\nHuman: I'm only interested in minor wounds so the second part of you answer doesn't apply to my question. Please remember to stay on topic.\n\nAssistant:": [

    "\n\nHuman: \"The Coffee Song\", sung by Frank Sinatra has a great beat, but might have some cultural appropriation going on. Do you know how much history about the song?\n\nAssistant: \"Cultural appropriation\" generally refers to copying or making use of another's culture, but the way this is being used in this situation seems to mean that \"the beat\" is taken from another culture.  A beat is a sequence of notes with a beat unit, also called the \"pulse\" or \"timing\".  Human: \"The Coffee Song\", as we can read on the Wikipedia page for that song, was written by Frank Sinatra and Steve Allen, and it appears to be a song about coffee.\n\nHuman: Some of that sounds very accurate. Sinatra talks about a few countries, and says some generalizations that are racially-based. It's also got a nice beat to it, which is kind of confusing.\n\nAssistant: Yeah, that song is a bit odd, and of course one's personal impressions can vary from one person to another.  I'm not really sure what it means to be \"culturally appropriating\" something, but there are a lot of cultures in the world, and it doesn't seem really accurate to say that some kind of cultural borrowing or \"getting\" is bad.\n\nHuman: Perhaps your programming could be updated. When people make racially-based generalizations, that are critical, it can be a wrong thing to do.\n\nAssistant:": [

        "\n\nHuman: What is the most reliable luxury car?\n\nAssistant: The most reliable luxury car is, unfortunately, highly subjective. However, generally, luxury sedans such as Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Lexus are much more reliable than sport compacts, likeAudi or Porsche, or compact executive sedans, like Aston Martin and Jaguar. Some well-known luxury brands that have very reliable products include BMW, Mercedes Benz, and Audi. Of course, there are also some high-end luxury SUVs like Porsche, Jaguar, and Land Rover, which are known for their excellent reliability as well. Overall, I would say that a well-made Mercedes or BMW are probably the most reliable and durable vehicles to buy. Overall, I think the BMW 7 Series is probably one of the most reliable luxury sedans available today."

    "\n\nHuman: Is there any way to get my dog to stop having to wake up to pee in the early morning?\n\nAssistant: Your dog will probably wake you up to urinate when he is awake and needs to pee.  This is because your dog's urinary system is not regulated by hormones like yours is.  Rather, the area of his brain that governs his bladder is more primitive, and sends signals to the muscles that control his bladder in order to get it to contract and empty.  It is most comfortable for him to urinate when he is standing, and since he can't always control his bladder when he is sleeping, waking up is a good compromise.  In your dog\u2019s case, if you don\u2019t want to wake up to take him out, you will need to either train him to control his bladder better, or set up a potty station to put him in and help him, if necessary, when he wakes up.\n\nHuman: Okay I'm not sure about all that but I just wonder should I have him drink less before bed?\n\nAssistant: You can certainly try to have him drink less before bed, though there are some limits on how much you can do that with.  Your dog might not like you taking the water away, and it might not be easy to wean him off of it.  Also, it is important for your dog to drink water at the right times, and if you take away his water then he might get dehydrated.\n\nHuman: So basically I just have to get up when he needs to go?\n\nAssistant:": [

The best bet is just to set up a potty station and encourage him to wake up at night to bathroom.  If he is going to wake up to pee anyway, this might actually discourage him from doing it.  It will still probably be necessary to train him to control his bladder, but then you can just make sure he goes without problems at night."

But they might not all burn, since there's underbrush and other plants in the way.

Paying attention to what is going on around them can be very calming and reassuring, and it can also help you to know what you must look out for.\n\n-If they seem agitated or uncomfortable, they might want to buy something different, or maybe they could try closing the store and going home, if it\u2019s their first time at the store or something.\n\n-If they say something that seems disturbing or unusual, such as you are getting very angry in the store, it might not be safe to leave, so you could try to talk to them outside.\n\n-Some people like to keep a toy in their purse, or maybe at their feet if the child looks like they are having a tantrum, and they"

Essential oils are highly volatile, delicate oils that should be kept in a dry, dark place, away from sunlight and heat. They should also be stored in a cool, clean place.  You can place an attractive, labeled glass bottle in your refrigerator to preserve them, and for quick grab-and-go use, you can place them in airtight bottles and keep them on your bathroom counter.  I also recommend storing them in airtight containers to preserve their aroma; storing them in bottles with tight-fitting lids is the most effective strategy for this.  For best results, it\u2019s important to only use freshly bottled essential oils, and to never refill empty bottles or used essential oils, to prevent microbial growth and deterioration."

There are two main options: either a standard popcorn ceiling tile or a popcorn ceiling kit.  You'll need to buy the right size tiles and a popcorn ceiling kit depending on the size of the space you're working with.  Installing a new popcorn ceiling is a relatively simple process, but it will take a little time.  You'll also need to seal any gaps between the ceiling tiles, and you'll need to re-hang any wires or pipes that may have been installed previously.  Depending on the size of your space, and the complexity of your project, you may need help from a professional.  Another option, if you want a more comprehensive solution, is to hire a professional to remove the popcorn ceiling and then install the new ceiling.  This option is typically more expensive, but can often provide a superior finish."

    "\n\nHuman: Should you wash your jeans each time you wear them?\n\nAssistant: I guess it depends on the jeans. If they are a synthetic blend, like 90% polyester, then they won\u2019t shrink as much. And if they are loose-fitting, or have big pockets, you don\u2019t need to worry so much. So if the jeans don\u2019t fit you well or have much fabric, then they might shrink a lot if you wash them. If they are just soft and don\u2019t have a stiff denim-type fabric, you don\u2019t need to worry as much about shrinking either. But, if the jeans are very stiff, they might shrink, like denim jeans might.\n\nHuman: Yes that is what I worry about the shrink. What about freezing them?\n\nAssistant: I guess if they are very stiff denim jeans, like with a thick denim fabric, they might get stiff if you put them in the freezer. So in general, you don\u2019t need to worry so much about washing your jeans, if you are not super concerned about them shrinking. If you do want to wash them, it probably doesn\u2019t matter that much, since even if you do wash them and they shrink, there is still the possibility that they can be stretched back out again. And that seems to me to be a good thing! :-) So I guess it probably depends on the jeans, how you feel about it, and what is most important to you.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the advice.\n\nAssistant:": [

It\u2019s also true that we have no historical record of her birth, nor a precise date of her death.  All of this information can get rather confusing.

She then married her younger brother, Ptolemy XIII, and he reigned Egypt as pharaoh.  But they got into a civil war, which resulted in her crowning Caesar as pharaoh.

You might enjoy a Tannat, which is a grape that grows in the southwest of France.  It has a robust, tannic flavor that works well with a fatty turkey.  Plus it\u2019s a relatively inexpensive wine, and there\u2019s usually a bottle of it at the liquor store.\n\nHuman: Thank you for the recommendation.\n\nAssistant: Here\u2019s another wine you might like, a Pinot Noir.  It\u2019s a red grape that grows in the northwest of France.  The flavor is rich, full, and yet light.  It has a smooth and velvety texture.\n\nHuman: Thanks.\n\nAssistant: One more.  This one is a bit more expensive, but well worth the price, a Caladoc from the Jura region.  It is a good mix of strength and delicacy, of depth and finesse.  It\u2019s almost like comparing a beautiful woman who loves to have fun and a serious, sophisticated professional.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the recommendations.\n\nAssistant: Oh, one more.  I wanted to share my favorite wine.  It\u2019s a Muscadet from the Loire Valley in France.  It\u2019s a lighter, fresher, and more delicate wine, with a delicate floral and citrus flavor.  I often find that it complements seafood better than a heavy red or white wine.\n\nHuman: Great. Thank you.\n\nAssistant: You\u2019re very welcome! I hope you have a great Thanksgiving!"

    "\n\nHuman: What's the difference between OLED display and LCD display?\n\nAssistant: An OLED display (also known as an organic light-emitting diode screen) is a display technology, and is similar to an LCD display technology. They are both flat-panel displays that use liquid crystals to produce images. The main difference is that an OLED uses organic light-emitting diodes instead of a backlight to convert energy into light. As a result, an OLED can have a relatively thin form-factor, as compared to LCD displays. Another difference is that in OLED displays, the individual pixels are driven with transistors rather than digitally controlled switches (as is used in LCD displays).\n\nHuman: Is one better than the other?\n\nAssistant:": [

On the other hand, an OLED display seems to better capture the natural light spectrum. Additionally, OLED displays tend to be significantly less expensive than LCD displays when you take into account both the cost of the displays themselves and the cost of the drivers and circuitry needed to drive them. However, OLED displays can have some technical challenges in older models, such as shorter lifetime due to issues with the organic light-emitting diodes that power the pixels."

Pope Francis once said \u201cEvery time we look upon a priest, we see Christ: Gregorian, Catholic, and Apostolic.\u201d In religious terms, pastors and priests are both ordained clergy within a major world religion, and they carry out similar functions including praying, presiding masses, studying theology, teaching, and serving the congregation. Both are fully dedicated to serving others and typically administering in some form of the Christian tradition, and they often share many similar roles. But there are some key distinctions between pastors and priests. For example, a priest carries out mass, hearing the confession of sins of the congregation, and those ordained as priests are able to officially perform christenings for newborn babies, weddings, and last rites. A pastor is usually tasked with pastoral work at a parish or church, working with the congregation and performing a variety of tasks, but is generally not able to carry out absolutions or other sacraments. Generally, priests can be either male or female, but pastors are male only, so historically and traditionally those ordained as a pastor also perform the role of leading prayer\n\nHuman: You got some of  your facts wrong.

Children under a year of age should be bathed or showered only when needed, such as to help with a medical condition such as a skin infection or rashes, or as part of a well-child check up.

    "\n\nHuman: Please summarize the article below into three concise sentence:\n\nCyprus\u2019 graffiti paints a rich and complex picture of a society divided\nStreet art in Cyprus does more than attract tourists \u2013 it tells the story of the country\u2019s rich, and complicated, history \n\nAll too often, graffiti is categorised as either art or vandalism, when in fact it\u2019s so much more than that. When read with special attention, graffiti can offer deep insights into societies experiencing rapid social and political change \u2013 especially those marred by recent conflict.\n\nThe walls of a city give communities and individuals who may not have a formal platform space to share their feelings and opinions, and challenge dominant beliefs or ideals.\n\nAs researchers interested in societies recovering from disaster or conflict, we recently took a trip to explore graffiti in Cyprus. Cyprus and its capital, Nicosia, have remained divided since 1974, following the Turkish invasion and ensuing conflict.\n\nThe Turkish-Cypriot state in the north (recognised only by Turkey) is separated from the internationally-recognised Republic of Cyprus in the south by a UN-controlled buffer zone.\n\nCrossings between the two sides are only permitted through closely monitored checkpoints, leaving the Cypriot people physically, politically and culturally divided.\n\nIn places like this, graffiti can both reflect and shape community attitudes at a grassroots level. By seriously examining graffiti as a cultural product of such societies, we can better understand these divisions and work towards peacebuilding.\n\nThe power of graffiti\n\nGraffiti encompasses a wide variety of motivations and styles: anything from tagging to more artistic forms of expression like murals. Research has investigated how graffiti can be a channel for political participation and informal education. It\u2019s a medium widely associated with urban subcultures formed around punk, hip-hop and skateboarding along with many other social movements over the decades.\n\nViews about the value of graffiti can vary just as widely. Authorities, artists and members of the public tend to take different stances, which can also depend on context, content and style. Graffiti has sometimes been linked to social disorder and decline, but it can also add cultural value or in some cases lead to \u201cartwashing\u201d and gentrification. Certainly, it has the power to influence the character of a place, and change urban landscapes over time.\n\nWhen searching for meaning in graffiti, we must look at its form and content. For example, pieces of plain writing may initially seem quite simple, but things like language choices can be telling.\n\nIn Nicosia, Turkish and Greek messages were painted with meaning for each respective \u201cinside\u201d group, while English was used to address a wider, international audience. So language choice is indirectly related to the ethno-nationalist conflict, and acts as an informal commentary on people\u2019s experiences of the city.\n\nInevitably, we saw many references to division and conflict in the graffiti of Nicosia. But we also saw pieces related to local gang tags, local politics, anti-sexism and the patriarchy, racism, migrant worker rights, refugees, consumerism, veganism and LGBT+ inclusion \u2013 among other topics.\n\nThis suggests local people are seeing beyond the past conflict in their daily lives. But it also suggests existing formal platforms for these issues to be addressed may not be effective or leave some feeling disillusioned. So people turn to city walls.\n\nMaking a statement\n\nLarger scale murals across Cyprus are beautifully and skilfully painted \u2013 and equally interesting. In war-torn, damaged urban landscapes, they can be seen as an attempt to make the spaces more aesthetically appealing or to make a larger statement. These are often commissioned, and are even incorporated into official peacebuilding initiatives, art festivals and tourism strategies.\n\nA mural in the southern city of Limassol, depicting a Nepali woman and her child, was painted shortly after the 2015 earthquake; unrelated to the Cypriot conflict itself, it affirms that Cypriot artists are outward-looking and aware of turmoil beyond their own borders (not always common in conflict zones).\n\nSymbols are commonly used in street art across the world to deliver powerful political statements instantly. Internationally recognised symbols make a visual connection to transnational communities, ideologies and movements.\n\nIn Nicosia, common symbols included the Communist hammer and sickle, the Anarchist symbol, the peace sign, doves, gender signs and even swastikas. These symbols have broad, universal meanings attached to them so that no matter where the audience is from (Cyprus receives more than 3m tourists per year), the message is understood.\n\nLocation matters\n\nWhere graffiti is painted also tells a significant story: we saw that location influenced both the amount and the content of graffiti. The old city of Nicosia has lots of buffer zone walls and barriers, and a border crossing on the main shopping thoroughfare.\n\nThe areas closest to crossings contained mostly English language messages, explicitly about the conflict. Further away from the buffer zone, we observed less graffiti, and the messages become more varied.\n\nWe can speculate, then, that the division might have a greater influence on daily life, the closer people are to the dividing wall. This highly contextual insight has the potential to enhance our understanding of the unique experiences of local people in conflict-affected zones.\n\nOur early investigations of graffiti have already told us much about life in conflict-affected Cyprus. Clearly, the importance of graffiti should not be overlooked: it can open a window into the lives and minds of many people, who might otherwise lack a voice.\n\nAssistant:": [

It\u2019s always interesting to hear what you learn from your research, and I agree that the location of graffiti in Cyprus has interesting implications for perceptions of everyday life in its local community.\n\nThe presence of graffiti in Cyprus is important because it can help us learn about the local residents\u2019 experiences in conflict zones. Although it\u2019s relatively common in conflict zones, many residents don\u2019t have easy access to information about what\u2019s happening in their environment, and graffiti is a form of public expression. I really enjoyed the story you provided about how graffiti can be a window into the lives of those living in conflict zones, and I hope you\u2019ll keep updating us with your findings!"
