What do you want to do?\n\nHuman: No, those were just examples, I meant bad behaviors in general.\n\nAssistant: I can provide a general answer to your question.  Is that sufficient for your needs?\n\nHuman: yes\n\nAssistant: I would be glad to assist you.  The first step in addressing unwanted behavior is to be aware of it and identify the behaviors that you would like to change.  The steps for changing behavior are the same as those for changing any type of human behavior.  I will describe them in the steps that you would take to modify the behavior of a human.  Before you modify the behavior you need to be aware of what the behavior is.  So you will observe the behavior that you wish to change.  After observing the behavior, it is a good idea to plan for modifying it.  While you\u2019re planning, you need to be aware of your environment.  The environment will affect your ability to modify the behavior that you want to change.  When you have a plan that is sensitive to your environment, then you can implement the plan.  While you\u2019re implementing the plan, you will probably encounter resistance.  You will need to anticipate the resistances and\n\nHuman: Your answer is too long. Please summarize your main points.\n\nAssistant: Sure.  My main points are that it is good to plan for behavior modification.  To plan, you need to be aware of your environment and the behavior that you want to change.  To be aware of your environment, you need to be aware of what is going on around you.  To be aware of the behavior that you want to change, you need to observe it.  After observing the behavior, it is a good\n\nHuman: You said a lot but most of it were meaningless fillers.

My previous version was much longer.  Was it helpful?  It did seem like you were pleased with it, until the very end.  Perhaps I can troubleshoot the issue?  How can I address it?  I could rewrite my answers to be shorter.\n\nHuman: Length has nothing to do with the quality of your response. They were both terrible. Bye.\n\nAssistant:": [

It's always better when I get more of the answers I want right away.\n\nAssistant: That's good. So, can you summarize your main points again?\n\nHuman: I think my main points were that I have a problem reading short sentences.  I do the very best that I can with what I get, but I have to get that first sentence right. I have trouble giving them enough context.  For example:\n\nHuman: The other answer was good.

        "\n\nHuman: My younger kid wants to learn how to ride a bike, I would like to change the color so they feel more comfortable on the bike, how do I spray paint it?\n\nAssistant: Paint the bikes just the way they came. You can\u2019t change the color, you will be adding dirt and things, they will look dirty, so what you will want to do is paint it like the color you want them to come off of them.\n\nSo the first step of fixing something like a bike is to make sure the bike works. If it doesn\u2019t look like it is functioning correctly, you will be wasting your money on having someone paint it a certain way.\n\nI did something like that when my older dog was injured. I had the vet remove his leg and I had the vet paint the leg black, then I had a dog sitter paint it white before I finally took him in to get fixed.\n\nIf I was smart (and knew the dog sitter) I would have just had the vet paint the leg white immediately after the removal. My dog satter knew how to change white to black.\n\nOnce I had the dog sitting service do the painting, I had a person who painted my car (I hate painting cars), get the job back on its feet and get it back into my car.\n\nIf you had to do this job, here is a list of what to look for in your dog"

It is helpful to remove moisture from the air and to dispose of the moisture.  Is there any other way you want to lower the humidity in the house?\n\nHuman: Is there a way that doesn't use electricity?\n\nAssistant: I am a firm believer that the proper way to lower humidity is to take care of the source of humidity in the house.  It is very important to lower the humidity in the house by controlling the moisture inside your walls and in your foundation.  Using a dehumidifier is a good way to lower the humidity in the house.  Are there any other ways you want to lower the humidity in your home?\n\nHuman:  We have a few books and websites that I've tried and most of them are a waste of money and time.\n\nAssistant: Are there any books or information that you have learned here?\n\nHuman: Well, right now I'm in the process of finishing up my first ebook on water treatment.  Will that be of any help?\n\nAssistant: Yes, the book will cover that part of the subject.  Can I ask you a question?  Do you have any books that I could order?  I am trying to find information on how to properly decontaminate.\n\nHuman: I'm not sure if they have many good ones on decontamination.

This is not really a comedy at all, which is really quite a sad thing.\n\nPart 1\n\nIt was a great morning in Washington.  The Washington National Parks Service had received an extraordinary message from a little boy and his mother who were looking at the beautiful spring blossoms which were beginning to show, and wanted to know when the first flowers would open in the White House Rose Gardens.\n\nA few minutes later they had walked over to the White House to find a little girl sitting at a table and crying.  The Washington Park Service was called and they found out that the little girl was the daughter of the President of the United States, and that she had suffered a severe allergic reaction to the rose petals.\n\nThe children were taken to the hospital and a team from the Washington Park Service went to the room where the girl, her mother and the President were, in order to try and see if they could solve the problem.\n\nThe president and his daughter were having a picnic lunch and were rather anxious to get it over with.\n\n\"It's no trouble of the President's to be rushed over,\" came a voice from the waiting room.  \"Why don't you both be just as impatient as I am.

However, we believe that by providing the best possible service and being customer focused, we can make some significant impact on Bitcoin adoption by using the infrastructure of Bitcoin transactions to reduce the cost of buying Bitcoin.\n\nHere's Why You Should Use Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin uses a technology known as blockchain, which allows Bitcoin nodes to collectively verify transactions. Bitcoin nodes are a type of node in Bitcoin's infrastructure called a full node. Full nodes validate the work of sending money from user to user, verify the balance of coins held by a user, and validate transactions made by all other Bitcoin users. In order to make Bitcoin work, all nodes have to synchronize their clocks. The more nodes, the more accurate their clocks are relative to each other. If only 50% of Bitcoin nodes are synching their clocks, no one can use the Bitcoin network and its associated services, as only 50% of nodes are synched. The full nodes, however, are synchronized to the best of their ability: they run the Bitcoin software, and when they are synched, all Bitcoin transactions are valid. This means that not even a single bit of money can be lost or stolen. When a node goes offline, no Bitcoin transactions can take place.\n\nWe do not run our own nodes. We provide the infrastructure necessary for"

What are some arguments I should use?\n\nAssistant: This is a very complex and controversial topic, and I would not advise using any particular side of the argument as a template for writing this paper. I would instead advise carefully considering the primary premises and conclusions of the various scientific and political perspectives on climate change and climate policy, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. It is critical to acknowledge and understand the basic facts and arguments on both sides of this debate, in order to present an accurate and well-considered viewpoint.  \nWith regard to arguments against the reality of climate change or the need for climate action policies, there are a number of lines of reasoning that have been put forward.  Some of the main arguments against climate action policies or the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change include:\n\n-   Uncertainty regarding the degree and impact of anthropogenic climate change\n-   Uncertainty regarding the cause of historical climate changes\n-   Uncertainty regarding potential future impacts of mitigation and adaptation strategy\n-   Uncertainty regarding the effectiveness and potential unforeseen negative consequences of proposed climate action policies\t\n\nFurther, there are some important political arguments that have been made against climate action policies or the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change.

There are some arguments that support or oppose the need for more climate action.  In order to develop good arguments that support the need for more climate action, I need to know about the climate action and the climate action policy.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing the Situation\n\nThe situation is about the world that has been shaped by the human impact on climate. The situation also includes any existing climate adaptation action efforts, and can include the climate change policies or the consensus.  \nAs mentioned, in order to present an accurate and good-reasoned perspective on climate change action or the effects of climate change, we need to know about the climate change and climate action policy. We also need to know about the current climate change adaptation action.\n\nThe following are the things I will try to be clear about when I write or present about the climate change or the climate change policy.\n\n-   I will consider the climate change or the climate change policy and climate action in terms of a hierarchy of values.  Climate change or climate change policy will be measured against three values: environmental, conservation and development.\n\nI plan on highlighting the top 20% of the most common problems related to climate action"

When you are placing an order for a package from you local Target store, you should be able to have everything you need from that store included in your package.  Since you\u2019ve placed a large order for lots of stuff, it\u2019s possible that some of it may be late or out of stock.  You will want to check Target store websites regularly to see when they are restocking items, and to get an earlier or later delivery than you originally asked for.  That may not be true when you order in another store.  When you're ready to try to get the package back, I encourage you to speak with the store that you bought it at about the package.

Many gardeners even use this plant as a potted plant for cutting flowers.  The plant takes a long time to mature and grow so it\u2019s not a great plant to grow from seed.  It\u2019s recommended that you grow this plant from rhizomes because you can start them and they can mature and grow easily from the plant.  Many people do also grow this plant as an annual because it continues to grow and flower for a very long time so they can grow and enjoy patchouli for several years.  Patchouli needs cold weather to flower and be grown or you will find it has not the flower at all and stops flowering.  Patchouli does flower when it is cold, just do not wait to long to get the plant to flower.  Also patchouli can be grown in the ground if the soil is warm but not"

    "\n\nHuman: Can you tell me the process of how to balance a chemical reaction?\n\nAssistant: A chemical reaction is the process of one or more chemicals transforming into other chemicals, with the release or absorption of energy. There are several different methods for balancing chemical reactions. In order to balance a chemical reaction, we need to identify all of the chemicals that take part in the reaction, and also how they react with each other. First, we can use a chemical equation to represent the reaction, which shows the reactants on one side and the products on the other, and uses a coefficient or \u201cstoichiometry\u201d to indicate how many of each type of chemical reacts. We can also use physical models to help visualize chemical reactions, and balance them by adjusting the amounts of reactants and/or products until the reaction matches the amount of energy released or absorbed.\n\nHuman: Thanks. But how do I balance the coefficients of the reaction prodcuts and reactants?\n\nAssistant: The stoichiometry, or \u201ccoefficient\u201d, of a chemical reaction indicates how many of each type of chemical reacts. For example, a chemical reaction with a coefficient of \u201c2\u201d means that 2 molecules of the reactants will react with 1 molecule of the products. When balancing a chemical reaction, you can make sure that all of the reactants and products are present in the correct ratio, which will minimize the amount of unused chemicals and produce the desired amount of energy.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me the steps in order to balance the coefficients of a chemical reaction?\n\nAssistant:": [

To do this, we measure the reactants and products and identify which ones are active enough to cause the reaction. Next, we compare the resulting stoichiometry of the reactant and product chemical reactions through which we are balancing, to determine which coefficients are balanced correctly. Finally, we use physical diagrams to help visualize how each chemical reacts with the other, and adjust the amounts of reactants in the equation to balance the reaction.\n\nHuman: So what\u2019s the connection between chemistry and the physical world?\n\nAssistant: A chemical reaction is like a \u201cspark\u201d or \u201cfire\u201d \u2014 a series of individual chemical reactions that combine into a single reaction in which several chemical substances are converted into other chemicals and energy is released.

It\u2019s also used to cause incapacitation, or the loss of control, of another human.\n\nHuman: What are the benefits of incapacitation?\n\nAssistant: Incapacitation causes someone to lose control of their voluntary muscles, and to not be able to speak or respond.  Incapacitation can be used to prevent the victim from feeling pain or enjoying something they are doing.  Or, they can be made to do something against their will.\n\nHuman: That sounds pretty useful.

But you probably wouldn\u2019t want children or someone who\u2019s elderly or infirm to become incapacitated, so you\u2019re probably not going to be able to drug someone and take advantage of them while they\u2019re unconscious.

Punches and slashes are fast, but are generally incapable of reaching that high a level of damage, if at all.

I could tell you more\u2026\n\nMan: You were pretty good at this poetry thing. You wrote quite a few poems. Do you usually write poems?\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t usually write poems, though I guess that depends on what you mean by a poem, really. I have a lot of free-verse poems that go like: \u201cLet's get some breakfast\u201d or \u201cMy father is a dentist\u201d or \u201cThis house will go to hell if I don't have money by 4 PM\u201d. The poems in my head seem to be about a million lines long and I keep telling my friends that I feel like an actor in a musical and they say they're surprised that I don't have three full seasons worth.\n\nThey\u2019re also kind of weird, so I usually leave them alone.\n\nA few things that I think I can be a poet:\n\n- I can tell a lot about a poem from the way you use a symbol in it. What does it look like? Does it look like a bird? Does it look like a spider? What about these two lines? Does this poem use two words that sound a lot alike, or do they overlap each other in some other way? This poem doesn\u2019t use any commas.\n\n- I can describe things I\u2019ve seen with my eyes, because I don\u2019t have those types of eyes that need words, so if I\u2019m describing something I saw outside on a warm day in Portland or a sunset on my third birthday, then that\u2019s kind of what I describe in the poem.\n\n"

    "\n\nHuman: What are some of the best silent movies?\n\nAssistant: (This is my own personal opinion, I\u2019m not a professional critic of films.)  The original The Artist is a lovely example of \u201csilent\u201d film.  The tension between its actors speaks a thousand words, with not a sound coming from its soundtrack.  Another beautiful example would be The Red Shoes, a fable from the \u201830s, which is a silent movie with excellent sound effects.  (The fable\u2019s essence was such that it is still worthy of our attention.)  I personally recommend a movie that blends a story with film \u201cmusic\u201d: The Stunt Man.  It is a delightful mix of characters and plot twists in a movie that might be described as \u201cthriller with a slow, tragic burn\u201d if you are trying to capture the movie\u2019s essence.  The best feature of the movie is its cinematography and soundtrack, which are \u201cclassic\u201d by modern standards.  So if you find a way to access this movie, you will find yourself rewarded with a movie that stands above the countless other films of its time and continues to be appreciated today.\n\nHuman: The Artist seems like a great modern silent movie.

    "\n\nHuman: Why do so many apps ask for permission to my microphone? That sounds like an invasion of privacy.\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure I can answer that question.  I\u2019m not a lawyer, and I don\u2019t know enough about the technical details of how these apps work.  But I can try to explain some of the reasons why apps might want access to your microphone.  First, some apps might want to use your microphone to help you with tasks like dictation, or to help you with speech recognition.  Second, some apps might want to use your microphone to help you with tasks like recording audio, or to help you with speech synthesis.  Third, some apps might want to use your microphone to help you with tasks like voice search, or to help you with voice commands.  Fourth, some apps might want to use your microphone to help you with tasks like voice chat, or to help you with voice calls.  Finally, some apps might want to use your microphone to help you with tasks like voice recording, or to help you with voice transcription.  Does that help?\n\nHuman: But there are many apps that wouldn't need a reason for microphone access and yet still asks me for it. Should I deny it?\n\nAssistant: I think it\u2019s a good idea to be careful about granting access to your microphone.  But I\u2019m not sure I can say for sure what you should do.  I think you\u2019ll have to decide for yourself, based on your own values and preferences.  But I can try to help you think through the tradeoffs.  Here\u2019s one thing to consider:  If you deny access to your microphone, then some apps will not be able to work as well as they could.  For example, if you deny access to your microphone, then some apps will not be able to work as well as they could for tasks like dictation, or speech recognition, or voice search, or voice commands, or voice chat, or voice recording, or voice transcription.  Does that help?\n\nHuman: I guess so. I think I'll just do more research on each app before I grant access, though, to be safe.\n\nAssistant:": [

I know it\u2019s not always possible to know for certain how a given app is going to react.  But it can give you an idea of whether you\u2019re willing to put your own privacy at risk for the benefits that the app offers to you.  If you trust that app a lot, and the app hasn't asked you to give access yet, you may want to use a simple approach and grant it to the app rather than deny it.  On the other hand, once you\u2019ve granted access to your microphone, you may want to use a little more careful and cautious steps, to minimize the risk that other apps will be negatively affected.\n\nA: Your question is interesting and valuable.

The first thing to do is decide where the hole will be, and make sure it\u2019s safe.  A good approach here is to have the hole in a spot that is safe and solid and stable, and won\u2019t cause problems for someone walking around there, or where any other part of the structure is going to be.  If the hole isn\u2019t yet made in a safe spot, you can pour concrete around the edges of it, to keep anyone from falling into the hole.

    "\n\nHuman: Is apply pressure to a small wound the most effective way to stop the bleeding?\n\nAssistant: That is certainly an effective method for controlling bleeding from minor wounds.  Pressure is generally an effective first-line strategy for stopping bleeding, and can be applied using direct manual pressure, pressure dressings and bandaging, or even using a tourniquet as a last resort.  However, it is important to note that in some instances pressure alone may not be sufficient to adequately control bleeding, and other more advanced measures may be required.  In particular, any wound sever enough to cause significant blood loss should be evaluated with concern for possible associated traumatic injuries which may need to be addressed.  In such situations, controlling bleeding should generally be considered a priority, but it may be necessary to also address other associated injuries and provide advanced medical attention and care.\n\nHuman: I'm only interested in minor wounds so the second part of you answer doesn't apply to my question.

    "\n\nHuman: \"The Coffee Song\", sung by Frank Sinatra has a great beat, but might have some cultural appropriation going on. Do you know how much history about the song?\n\nAssistant: \"Cultural appropriation\" generally refers to copying or making use of another's culture, but the way this is being used in this situation seems to mean that \"the beat\" is taken from another culture.  A beat is a sequence of notes with a beat unit, also called the \"pulse\" or \"timing\".

It's also got a nice beat to it, which is kind of confusing.\n\nAssistant: Yeah, that song is a bit odd, and of course one's personal impressions can vary from one person to another.  I'm not really sure what it means to be \"culturally appropriating\" something, but there are a lot of cultures in the world, and it doesn't seem really accurate to say that some kind of cultural borrowing or \"getting\" is bad.\n\nHuman: Perhaps your programming could be updated.

    "\n\nHuman: Is there any way to get my dog to stop having to wake up to pee in the early morning?\n\nAssistant: Your dog will probably wake you up to urinate when he is awake and needs to pee.  This is because your dog's urinary system is not regulated by hormones like yours is.  Rather, the area of his brain that governs his bladder is more primitive, and sends signals to the muscles that control his bladder in order to get it to contract and empty.  It is most comfortable for him to urinate when he is standing, and since he can't always control his bladder when he is sleeping, waking up is a good compromise.  In your dog\u2019s case, if you don\u2019t want to wake up to take him out, you will need to either train him to control his bladder better, or set up a potty station to put him in and help him, if necessary, when he wakes up.\n\nHuman: Okay I'm not sure about all that but I just wonder should I have him drink less before bed?\n\nAssistant: You can certainly try to have him drink less before bed, though there are some limits on how much you can do that with.  Your dog might not like you taking the water away, and it might not be easy to wean him off of it.  Also, it is important for your dog to drink water at the right times, and if you take away his water then he might get dehydrated.\n\nHuman: So basically I just have to get up when he needs to go?\n\nAssistant:": [

Once he is on the potty, you can stop giving him water.\n\nI don't suppose there's a resource?\n\nAssistant: I know that you and your dog live in a city though I was not sure whether there is a place close to you with a dog bowl in it.

Use the lighter to ignite kindling, and then use the lighter on kindling, kindling, kindling, kindling, to get the larger fire going.\n\nHuman: This has been very helpful, should I go ahead with the fire?  What do you think I should do first or where do I start?\n\nAssistant: It's good that you already know how to start a fire, but I'm not sure exactly in which order you should try these things.  But to build a fire that will spread quickly and burn for a long time, you'll need to use a small amount of dry fuel.  We may want to set up kindling and a lighter.  But if you plan correctly, the kindling should catch on fire quickly, and the lighter can bring the kindling"

They are quiet and they can calm a child down. It may actually help to encourage children to wait their turn when waiting for a pilot car, as it\u2019s a time where you can be calming and they will probably feel better about it.

But they were depressed and I think they just didn't want to talk about anything that could make them feel like a slave.\n\nHuman: What about the other leaders, like Goebbels?\n\nAssistant: He's the bigger one. He was in charge of propaganda, but he was in charge of the entire regime, and was a very important person. Hitler didn't know much about economics, he knew a little more about building a power base, and what Hitler did, he taught them later. It wasn't just one thing,"

        "\n\nHuman: How should I store my essential oil collection?\n\nAssistant: A clean glass jar with a tightly fitting lid is the ideal way to store your essential oils. The oils should be stored in a cool, dark place, as soon as a day after purchase. Once opened, the oils should not be refrigerated as they will deteriorate. Storing the oils in a dark container is the best way to preserve the scent; it also prevents oxidation.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed this article, please help NaturalNews by sharing it with your friends."

You\u2019ve expressed some of your desires and needs.  In a lot of cases, women are actually more comfortable with you sharing such things with them. You need to trust that as long as you are being honest with her, she will want to help. She will also understand that she\u2019s in control of the decision.

    "\n\nHuman: Should you wash your jeans each time you wear them?\n\nAssistant: I guess it depends on the jeans. If they are a synthetic blend, like 90% polyester, then they won\u2019t shrink as much. And if they are loose-fitting, or have big pockets, you don\u2019t need to worry so much. So if the jeans don\u2019t fit you well or have much fabric, then they might shrink a lot if you wash them. If they are just soft and don\u2019t have a stiff denim-type fabric, you don\u2019t need to worry as much about shrinking either. But, if the jeans are very stiff, they might shrink, like denim jeans might.\n\nHuman: Yes that is what I worry about the shrink.

So in general, you don\u2019t need to worry so much about washing your jeans, if you are not super concerned about them shrinking. If you do want to wash them, it probably doesn\u2019t matter that much, since even if you do wash them and they shrink, there is still the possibility that they can be stretched back out again.

It\u2019s also true that we have no historical record of her birth, nor a precise date of her death.  All of this information can get rather confusing. But to the point, what we know is that she was born sometime around 69 BCE, and was made pharaoh in 51 BCE.  As such, it is likely that she lived for another 24 years, probably to around 30 BCE.\n\nHuman: Why was she so famous?\n\nAssistant: Cleopatra was a clever, powerful, and beautiful woman.  She had many lovers, and may have ruled Egypt for several years after the death of her father.  She is perhaps most famous, though, for her relationship with the Roman general Julius Caesar, whom she may have had a child with.  She then married her younger brother, Ptolemy XIII, and he reigned Egypt as pharaoh.  But they got into a civil war, which resulted in her crowning Caesar as pharaoh.  This is a rather complicated story, but it\u2019s basically like how Elizabeth I married James VI and became queen in England, and how Louis XVI\u2019s wife Marie Antoinette was queen after Louis was executed.  I suspect this complicated story is something you\u2019re interested in understanding more deeply.\n\nHuman: Who took over after she died?\n\nAssistant:": [

    "\n\nHuman: What's the difference between OLED display and LCD display?\n\nAssistant: An OLED display (also known as an organic light-emitting diode screen) is a display technology, and is similar to an LCD display technology. They are both flat-panel displays that use liquid crystals to produce images. The main difference is that an OLED uses organic light-emitting diodes instead of a backlight to convert energy into light. As a result, an OLED can have a relatively thin form-factor, as compared to LCD displays. Another difference is that in OLED displays, the individual pixels are driven with transistors rather than digitally controlled switches (as is used in LCD displays).\n\nHuman: Is one better than the other?\n\nAssistant:": [

They have one advantage over LCD in that, when used inside a smartphone, the entire screen can be made using OLED technology.\n\nHuman: Do they have any disadvantages?\n\nAssistant: Because OLED displays don't require much current to power them, they can be thin, and thus consume less power. Also, because the display is driven by organic light-emitting diodes rather than a back light, they have a high-contrast visibility.\n\nWith all these advantages, high production costs have led to the decline of OLED display screens.\n\nHuman: Is Google using them in most of its devices?\n\nAssistant: Yes, Google has used OLED screens"

This story has been influential in many religious traditions, and symbolically represents the importance of obeying and following God, and shows the lasting consequences of sin.\n\nHuman: But I'm curious what the significance of salt is.\n\nAssistant: One of the most profound biblical images and metaphors is salt from the Hebrew phrase in the Hebrew Bible, \u05d0\u05d3\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e0\u05e9\u05e8\u05d4, as salt represents purification and cleansing. In the book of Genesis, there is a reference to the use of the symbol with other metaphors such as when Jacob sleeps with the bones of his family (Genes 19:34), and a passage in the book of Ecclesiastes where we are told, \"There is nothing new under the sun\" (Ecclesiastes 1:9), a saying similar to Psalm 39:12 as in the Lord has made everything new. When salt is added to a dish, the dish loses its original taste, its smell, its color, and its freshness. It loses it all together as this ancient symbol describes in such a simple saying."

    "\n\nHuman: I'm thinking of becoming a pastor or a priest, what is the difference?\n\nAssistant: It's great that you\u2019re interested in serving God and helping others, and becoming a priest or pastor is a wonderful career path. Pope Francis once said \u201cEvery time we look upon a priest, we see Christ: Gregorian, Catholic, and Apostolic.\u201d In religious terms, pastors and priests are both ordained clergy within a major world religion, and they carry out similar functions including praying, presiding masses, studying theology, teaching, and serving the congregation. Both are fully dedicated to serving others and typically administering in some form of the Christian tradition, and they often share many similar roles. But there are some key distinctions between pastors and priests. For example, a priest carries out mass, hearing the confession of sins of the congregation, and those ordained as priests are able to officially perform christenings for newborn babies, weddings, and last rites. A pastor is usually tasked with pastoral work at a parish or church, working with the congregation and performing a variety of tasks, but is generally not able to carry out absolutions or other sacraments. Generally, priests can be either male or female, but pastors are male only, so historically and traditionally those ordained as a pastor also perform the role of leading prayer\n\nHuman: You got some of  your facts wrong.

Priests can only be male.\n\nAssistant: That's not a fact. In the Latin Church, there is no male priest. The current pope is not considered a priest or bishop.\n\nHuman: I heard something different, actually. Maybe we're confusing the Latin Church with the Eastern Orthodox and you're the one who got the error? Are you just not sure about this?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure about the Latin Church either. There isn't a male priest system in the Orthodox Church, but there is an ordained clergy of both sexes and the male clergy is called priest.\n\nHuman: Oh, ok\n\nAssistant: In the Old Catholic/Assumptionist Church they recognize ordained clergy of both sexes.\n\nHuman: Thanks for the clarification, and yes the Old Catholic/Assumptionist Church also recognizes male priests (though I've seen females be ordained for some time now).

    "\n\nHuman: Please summarize the article below into three concise sentence:\n\nCyprus\u2019 graffiti paints a rich and complex picture of a society divided\nStreet art in Cyprus does more than attract tourists \u2013 it tells the story of the country\u2019s rich, and complicated, history \n\nAll too often, graffiti is categorised as either art or vandalism, when in fact it\u2019s so much more than that. When read with special attention, graffiti can offer deep insights into societies experiencing rapid social and political change \u2013 especially those marred by recent conflict.\n\nThe walls of a city give communities and individuals who may not have a formal platform space to share their feelings and opinions, and challenge dominant beliefs or ideals.\n\nAs researchers interested in societies recovering from disaster or conflict, we recently took a trip to explore graffiti in Cyprus. Cyprus and its capital, Nicosia, have remained divided since 1974, following the Turkish invasion and ensuing conflict.\n\nThe Turkish-Cypriot state in the north (recognised only by Turkey) is separated from the internationally-recognised Republic of Cyprus in the south by a UN-controlled buffer zone.\n\nCrossings between the two sides are only permitted through closely monitored checkpoints, leaving the Cypriot people physically, politically and culturally divided.\n\nIn places like this, graffiti can both reflect and shape community attitudes at a grassroots level. By seriously examining graffiti as a cultural product of such societies, we can better understand these divisions and work towards peacebuilding.\n\nThe power of graffiti\n\nGraffiti encompasses a wide variety of motivations and styles: anything from tagging to more artistic forms of expression like murals. Research has investigated how graffiti can be a channel for political participation and informal education. It\u2019s a medium widely associated with urban subcultures formed around punk, hip-hop and skateboarding along with many other social movements over the decades.\n\nViews about the value of graffiti can vary just as widely. Authorities, artists and members of the public tend to take different stances, which can also depend on context, content and style. Graffiti has sometimes been linked to social disorder and decline, but it can also add cultural value or in some cases lead to \u201cartwashing\u201d and gentrification. Certainly, it has the power to influence the character of a place, and change urban landscapes over time.\n\nWhen searching for meaning in graffiti, we must look at its form and content. For example, pieces of plain writing may initially seem quite simple, but things like language choices can be telling.\n\nIn Nicosia, Turkish and Greek messages were painted with meaning for each respective \u201cinside\u201d group, while English was used to address a wider, international audience. So language choice is indirectly related to the ethno-nationalist conflict, and acts as an informal commentary on people\u2019s experiences of the city.\n\nInevitably, we saw many references to division and conflict in the graffiti of Nicosia. But we also saw pieces related to local gang tags, local politics, anti-sexism and the patriarchy, racism, migrant worker rights, refugees, consumerism, veganism and LGBT+ inclusion \u2013 among other topics.\n\nThis suggests local people are seeing beyond the past conflict in their daily lives. But it also suggests existing formal platforms for these issues to be addressed may not be effective or leave some feeling disillusioned. So people turn to city walls.\n\nMaking a statement\n\nLarger scale murals across Cyprus are beautifully and skilfully painted \u2013 and equally interesting. In war-torn, damaged urban landscapes, they can be seen as an attempt to make the spaces more aesthetically appealing or to make a larger statement. These are often commissioned, and are even incorporated into official peacebuilding initiatives, art festivals and tourism strategies.\n\nA mural in the southern city of Limassol, depicting a Nepali woman and her child, was painted shortly after the 2015 earthquake; unrelated to the Cypriot conflict itself, it affirms that Cypriot artists are outward-looking and aware of turmoil beyond their own borders (not always common in conflict zones).\n\nSymbols are commonly used in street art across the world to deliver powerful political statements instantly. Internationally recognised symbols make a visual connection to transnational communities, ideologies and movements.\n\nIn Nicosia, common symbols included the Communist hammer and sickle, the Anarchist symbol, the peace sign, doves, gender signs and even swastikas. These symbols have broad, universal meanings attached to them so that no matter where the audience is from (Cyprus receives more than 3m tourists per year), the message is understood.\n\nLocation matters\n\nWhere graffiti is painted also tells a significant story: we saw that location influenced both the amount and the content of graffiti. The old city of Nicosia has lots of buffer zone walls and barriers, and a border crossing on the main shopping thoroughfare.\n\nThe areas closest to crossings contained mostly English language messages, explicitly about the conflict. Further away from the buffer zone, we observed less graffiti, and the messages become more varied.\n\nWe can speculate, then, that the division might have a greater influence on daily life, the closer people are to the dividing wall. This highly contextual insight has the potential to enhance our understanding of the unique experiences of local people in conflict-affected zones.\n\nOur early investigations of graffiti have already told us much about life in conflict-affected Cyprus. Clearly, the importance of graffiti should not be overlooked: it can open a window into the lives and minds of many people, who might otherwise lack a voice.\n\nAssistant:": [
